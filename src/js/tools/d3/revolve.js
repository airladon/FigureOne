/*
This is a general revolve that takes a profile of points in the XY plane, revolve
rotates them around the X axis.

The points can then be transformed such that the x axis points in some
direction, and the [0, 0, (0)] point is translated to an arbitrary [x, y, z]
point.

All profile points must have a y value that is not 0, with the exceptions of
the ends which can be 0.

Normals for each vertex are returned which are either flat, averaged along the
profile ('curveProfile'), averaged along the direction of revolve rotation
('curveRadial'), or averaged by all surfaces touching the vertex ('curve').

Curve normals are combinations of surface normals around a point.

Each surface consists of 3 vertices if on the end of the profile and the
profile goes to 0, or 6 vertices otherwise.

The normals of each vertex of a surface can have 4 possibilities:
- flat: normals are the surface normal
- curveProfile: combination of normals for surfaces that touch the vertex, have
  the same revolve rotation, and are along the profile
- curveRadial: combination of normals for surfaces that touch the vertex, have
  have the same profile location, and are along the revolve rotation
- curve: combination of normals for surfaces that touch the vertex

c = current surface
n = next surface
p = previous surface
[revolve rotation][profile position]

e.g:
- cc = current surface
- nc = next surface along the revolve rotation, with the same profile position
- cn = next surface along the profile, that has the same revolve rotation


 profile
--------->

np  nc  nn       A
cp  cc  cn       |  revolve rotation
pp  pc  pn       |


A quad surface is defined by four points

profile
------->

b1    b2       A
   cc          |  revolve rotation
a1    a2       |

If the profile start is a 0, then the start surface is a triangle:

      b2
   cc
a1    a2


If the profile end is a 0, then the end surface is a triangle:

b1    b2
   cc
a1

So in general we have:

np     nc     nn
    b1    b2
cp     cc     cn
    a1    a2
pp     pc     pn

Which means the normals for vertex a1 will be:
- flat: cc
- curveProfile: cc + cp
- curveRadial: cc + pc
- curve: cc + pc + cp + pp

 * swept around the x axis
 * @property {number} [sides] number of sides in the radial sweep
 * @property {'flat' | 'curveRows' | 'curveRadial' | 'curve'} [normals]
 * `flat` normals will make shading (from a light source) across a face of the
 * object a constant color. `curveProfile` will gradiate the shading along the
 * profile. `curveRadial` will gradiate the shading around the radial sweep.
 * `curve` will gradiate the shading both around the radial sweep and along the
 * profile. Use `curve`, `curveProfile`, or `curveRadial` to make a surface
 * look more round with fewer number of sides.
 * @property {number} [rotation] by default the profile will start in the XY
 * plane and sweep around the x axis following the right hand rule. Use
 * `rotation` to start the sweep at some angle where 0ยบ is in the XY for +y and
 * 90ยบ is in the XZ plane for +z. initial angle of the revolve rotation
 * @property {TypeUserRotationDefinition} [axis] orient the final vertices by
 * rotating their definition around the x axis to an arbitrary rotation
 * @property {TypeParsablePoint} [position] offset the final vertices such that
 * the original (0, 0) point in the profile moves to position (this step
 * happens after the rotation)
 * @property {TypeParsableTransform} [transform] apply a final transform to

 * @property {boolean} [lines] if `true` then points representing
