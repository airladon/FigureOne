/**
 * Font definition object.
 *
 * A font can be defined either from a subset of the properties used to define
 * [fonts in css](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font), or
 * by using a texture altas of the various glyphs to be used.
 *
 * A font can be rendered into a [2D canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D)
 * or into the WebGL canvas using the texture atlas.
 *
 * A texture atlas can either be supplied as an image, or generated
 * automatically by FigureOne based on css font definitions.
 *
 * Choosing how to render text depends on the application.
 *
 * If text size is to be animated through a large scale range, then rendering
 * on the 2D canvas is advantageous as it can scale text to any size without a
 * loss of sharpness. The main disadvantage of the 2D canvas is the fact that
 * it's a different HTML canvas element to the WebGL canvas. Thus all text on
 * the 2D canvas will always be above (default) or below the WebGl canvas
 * independent of when it is drawn. This means text will always be above or
 * below shapes. regenerated each time the size changes by some threshold.
 *
 * Conversely, drawing text on the WebGL canvas provides control on which
 * shapes can hide text and vise versa. The disadvantage is that text is drawn
 * from a texture atlas of bitmapped fonts. This means as text is progressively
 * scaled up or down, the the text will look more pixelated or blurry. For many
 * scalings (like common scalings in an equation), this will likely not be a
 * problem. But for large changes in animated scale, it will be better to use
 * the 2D canvas. Scaling also needs to be considered if the WebGL canvas is
 * expected to be resized. On a desktop browser, a canvas element can be
 * resized a lot, and so if using the WebGL atlas, it may need to be
 *
 * Note, the choice of where to render text can be made for each text element.
 * Therefore it is possible to have some text rendered to the 2D canvas, and
 * other text rendered to the WebGL canvas in the same figure.
 *
 * A texture atlas can either be supplied as an image, or generated
 * automatically by FigureOne based on the css font definitions.
 *
 * CSS font definition:
 *   * `family` - the typeface family from which it comes (e.g. 'Helvetica',
 *     'Times New Roman')
 *   * `style` - its slope (e.g. 'italic')
 *   * `weight` - its thickness (e.g. 'bold')
 *   * `size`
 *
 * Atlas font definition:
 *   * `src` - the image or url to the image - if not supplied then atlas will
 *      be generated automatically
 *   * `map` - description of location and size of each glyph in the atlas
 *   * `glyphs` - the available glyphs in the atlas
 *   * `atlasColor` - if `true` then the rendered glyph color will be the same
 *     as that in the texture. If `false`, then only the transparency channel of
 *     the texture will be used and color will be defined by the FigureElement
 *     drawing the text.
 *   * `atlasSize` - if defined, and if the glyphs are generated automatically
 *     then the glyphs will be created with a pixel size that is `atlasSize`
 *     portion of the canvas height. If undefined, then the glyphs will be
 *     created with a pixel size that is the ratio of the font size to the
 *     scene height portion of the canvas height.
 *
 * A font can also have a number of modifying properties:
 *   * `color` - fill or outline color of each glyph - not used if the texture
 *      atlas color is to be used
 *   * `underline`
 *   * `outline` - defines whether the font is filled, is an outline, or both
 *
 * Fonts that are generated automatically rely on the client's browser to
 * measure the font's width. From this the ascent and descent of each glyph
 * is then estimated. Each glyph's width, ascent and descent is used to layout
 * the glyphs in regular text and equations, as well as determine the borders
 * and touch borders of FigureElements that draw the text.
 *
 * However, this estimate for different font families is not always perfectly
 * accurate. If the estimate is not sufficient, then it can be modified by using
 * the following properties (where each property is a proportion of the width
 * of a character 'a'):
 *   * `maxAscent`: Maximum ascent of glyphs like "A" or "$"
 *   * `midAscent`: ascent of mid level glyphs like "a" and "g"
 *   * `descent`: descent of glyphs that do not noticeably go below the
 *      baseline (but often do a little) like "a" and "b"
 *   * `midDescent`: descent of glyphs that go a little below the baseline like
 *      "," and ";"
 *   * `maxDescent`: maximum descent of glyphs like "g" and "|"
 *
 * Individual glyphs can also be modified (for atlas based fonts only) using
 * the `modifiers` property.
