This geometry both shows the relationships between the trionometric functions, as well as gives meaning to the names they have.

At it's heart, it is three similar right angle triangles. Any triangles with the same set of angles are similar, and so right angle triangles with an angle theta must all be similar as we have defined two angles - theta and the right angle.


>> Triangles have three angles that add to 180º, so only two angles are needed to define all three.

Welcome to this interactive video, introducing the trigonometric functions, where they come from and some of their relationships. This video is interactive, so if you see me interacting with an element on the screen, such as this radius line, then you can to.

The trigonometric functions come from the study of similar triangles and right angle triangles.
* Triangles that have the same set of angles, are similar triangles.
* Similar trianlges have the property that corresponding side ratios are equal.
* A right angle triangle has a right angle, and then when we define one more angle theta, we effectively define all three as their sum will always be 180º.
* So All right angle triangles with angle theta have the same set of angles and will be similar
* Meaning all right angle triangles with angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios
* These ratios are constant when theta is constant, but change when with theta, and so are a dependant on, or a function of theta.
* These are the trigonometric functions. Because of similar trianlges, they depend only on theta and apply to right angle triangles of all sizes.
* This geometry shows how the trigonometric functions are related, though we can also use it to see where the names come from.
* The tangent line is a line that touches the circle in one place, and is perpendicular to the radius line that touches at the same place.
* And so we call this line the tangent.
* The secant line is a line is a line that cuts through a circle
* And so we call this line the secant.
* The chord line is a line between two points on a circle
* This line is a half cord, and our word sine derived from Latin has its roots in Sanskrit and Ancient Greek as a half cord or half bowstring.
* This line is the tagent of the complementary angle of theta, and so we call it the complimentary tangent, cotangent or cot.
* This line is the secant of the complementary angle, and so we call it the cosecant, cosec or csc.
* This line is the sine of the complementary angle, and so we call it the cosine or cos.
* Our geometry is actually three similar triangles, each with a side of length 1 in a different position relative to theta.
* Let's take our first triangle, and fill in all the side ratios. The special cases here are csc over one and cot over one, as they simplify down to just the csc and cot.
* All triangles are similar, so side ratios are the same, so we can equate these to the side ratios of our second triangle.
* WE can do the same for the third triangle.
* Each ratio has a case that it is equal to just a single side, and these are the names of our trigonometric functions.
* We also have a lot of relationships between functions, though this is only a portion of what's possible. Nevertheless, only a subset of these are really useful to remember, as the remainder can be relatively easily derived from them.
* The geometry is interactive, so let's use play with it to find some interesting relationships or properties of the trigonometric functions.
* These are not the only relationships or properties, and they can also be found from studying the math, but sometimes a picture can highlight relationships that might not be as obvious in the Math.
* First, we can see as the angle get's smaller, it seems the tangent line and the sine line become more similar in length. This sine limit is a simplification in calculus that leads to many proofs.
* We can also see that at 45º, the cosec and sec are equal. This is expected as they are compliments of each other, and in fact, we can expect the same for the sine and cosine, and tan and cot.
* The tan and sec lines form a right angle triangle where the sec is the hypotenuse - thus the sec line must always be larger than the tan line.
* Let's extend this out to a circle, and consider the limits of the functions
* The sine and cosine are the x, y coordinates of each point on the circle.
* They form a right angle triangle and thus using pythagorus we can fnid another relationship between them
* As the hypotenuse is 1, then the sine and cosine lengths must always be between 0 and 1
* In contrast, the sec and cosec can range between -inf and inf, but never have values between 0 and 1
* Similarly, the tan and cot range from -inf to inf but can be all values in between
* Here is another geometry that shows the relationship between the trigonometric functions. It has the same three similar triangles, but flipped and rotated into different positions to show the full tangent line on a circle, and is useful for visualizing the sign of the sec and cosec functions, as well as seeing how the tangent and cotengent line lenghts are related.


* We can now fill in our ratios drawing from the names in each triangle.
* Now, we can also fill in a bunch more ratios and see any number of differen relationships, but really there are some that you will come across more frequently.


* As each triangle is similar, their side ratios are the same, but each triangle can be used to name two ratios by 
This means, each pair of ratios with the same denominator can be expressed with the side lengths from the triangle with the side of length 1 that is the 





* So, if you have a right angle triangle with angle theta, then you have defined angle theta, the right angle, and by extension the complementary angle, meaning all right angle triangles with angle theta will have the same set of angles and be similar.



Similar triangles have the property that the corresponding side ratios are the same. So these three triangles all have similar


Right angle trinagle intro

# Introduction
Welcome to this interactive video describing why the trigonmetric functions exist, and where they come from. This video is interactive, which means if you see me interacting with an element on the screen, for example this unit radius, then you can too. When you do, the video will pause, so just press play when you are ready to continue. 

Now this title geometry is what we'll be building up to in this video as it visually shows the relationship between all the trigonometric functions, as well as gives meaning to their names and where they come from. As the geometry is interactive, hopefully if you play around with it, you might get some insights into the relationships between the functions that might not have been as obvious when just looking at the math.

So to build this up, we first need to review the properties of similar triangles, as they are at the heart of the trigonometric functions.


# Similar Triangles
So, similar triangles have equal corresponding angles, or the same set of angles, they have corresponding sides that are all equally scaled and they have equal corresponding side ratios.

So for example, if you take the ratio of sides sA and sB from the bottom triangle, the factor s cancels and we are left with the ratio of corresponding sides A and B from the top triangle, and you can do this for any set of sides.

Now, all of these properties are a consequence of each other - meaning that triangles with any of these properties, will in fact have all of these properties and be similar.


>> Why is this so important? Well we will see the trigonometric functions are just side ratios, so when we develop the functions on one size of triangle, we can use this to show they actually apply to all sizes of triangles.

# Right Angle Triangles
With this in hand, let's talk about right angle triangles where one angle is a right angle. Now if we define one more angle theta, then because angles in a triangle always add to 180º, we are effectively defining all three angles.

So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta have the same set of angles.

This is a property of similar triangles, which means all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will be similar.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side


# Ratios
So for instance, the ratio between the side opposite theta and the hypotenuse will be have the same value,  or be constant, for any right angle triangle, no matter its size, as long as it has an angle theta.

It also means the ratio between the side adjacent to theta and the hypotenuse is constant for all right triangles with theta.

And we can say the same for all the different possible side ratios.

Now, these ratios are constant when theta is constant, but when we change theta, which we can do here by dragging the hypotenuse, we can see the ratio values change. This means each ratio is dependent on, or a function of theta. 

And these are the trigonometric functions.

# Names
## Lines
Each of these functions have abreviated names that come directly from Latin, and are not immediately intuitive. However, the names are all derived from just three different lines related to a circle, and knowing these lines can help make some sense of the names.

The first line is the one between any two points on a circle and is called a chord. The word chord comes from the latin word meaning bowstring, and you might see the bow when you highlight the arc between the cord.

The second line touches the circle in just one spot and is called a tangent line coming from the latin word meaning to touch. The tangent line has the property that it is at right angles to the radius line that touches the same point on the circle.

The third line cuts through the circle and is called a secant line coming from the latin word meaning to cut.

So, how do these three lines relate to our triangle ratios?

## Unit Circle
>Well, it's time to build up our geometry we saw at the start of this video, and our ultimate goal is to find several similar triangles, where each triangle has side that is length 1, but that side is different in each triangle, so in the first triangle it make be opposite theta, the second adjacent to theta and the third the hypotenuse. Now, as these triangles are similar, then their side ratios will all be the same, and 
*Start sentence with tangent*
>We start with a quarter circle or radius 1, also called a unit circle, because as you will see, if we can get that value of 1 into the denominator of these equations, it will simplify them. 
>However, our conclusions below generalize to circles of any radius, as the resulting triangles will be similar, as noted above.
*Introdcue reason for geometry*
We start with a quarter circle of radius 1, or a quarter unit circle, around which we construct a right angle triangle such that the hypotenuse is tangent to the circle and touching it at some angle theta.

## Tan Sec
Now with this radius line, we actually have two right angle triangles and in the lower triiangle, we can call the side opposite theta the tangent, which is a function of theta as the line length changes with theta. We often abreviate the tangent as tan theta or just tan.

Next, the hypotenuse of this triangle is a line that cuts through the circle, and so is a secant line, which we will abbreviate just as sec.

Now as our third side is the radius line with value 1, and it is adjacent to theta, let's substitue our sides into the ratios that have the adjacent side in the denominator.

So, the opposite over the adjacent is tan over one, or simply the tangent function. Similarly the hypotenuse over adjacent is the sec function.

Now, the upper triangle in the diagram is also a right angle triangle, and using complementary angles we can show it also has an angle theta. Thus it is similar to our first triangle and shares all the same side ratios.

## Cot CSC
This triangle also has a tangent line, but this time it is opposite the *complementary angle of theta*, and so its value is the *tangent of the complementary angle*. Therefore we will call it the complementary tangent of theta, or cotangent or cot for short.

Similarly the we have a complimentary secant line, which we call the cosec or csc for short.

And our third side has a value 1 but this time it is opposite theta, so we can fill in the two ratios with the opposite side in the denominator.
So adjacent over opposite is equal to the cot, and the hypotenuse over opposite is the cosec.

## Sin Cos
So, as our two similar triangles have had an adjacent side, and then an opposite side of value 1, we'll now construct a similar triangle with a hypotenuse of value one, with a vertical line that is half of a chord, and in fact when these ratios were first developed it was called the half chord or half bowstring. However when the concept was translated into Latin, which is where our word today comes from, this original meaning was lost. So our word sine, comes from the latin word sinus meaning bay or bossum, but really, just as we think of the tan as the tangent, and sec as the secant, we can think of the sine as the half chord, as that's what it is.

That said, our opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the sine.

Our last ratio come from the line that is the sine of the complementary angle, and so we call it the complementary sine, cosine or just cos for short. In this case the cosine is adjancent to angle theta, and so we say the adjacent over hypotenuse ratio is the cosine.

And so, that was kind of a long winded way to say, each of these ratios have a special abreviated name that comes from Latin and the relationship between circles, triangles, and complementary angles.

## Common relationships
### Complementary angles
Now let's look at how some of these trigonometric functions are related to each other.

Firstly, from our definitions of the functions we have three complementary functions, the complementary sine, complementary tangent and complementary secant.

Now if we look at our geometry, we can see that just as the cosine is the sine of the complementary angle, so the sine is the cosine of the complementary angle. And so, sin theta is equal to cosine of 90º minus theta.

Similarly, you can show our other complementary pairs have the same relationsihps so the tangent is equal to the cot of the complementary angle, and the secant equal to the cosec of the complementary angle.

So we have three complementary pairs of trigonometrics functions.
### Reciprocal pairs
We also have three reciprocal pairs of functions.

So the opposite over the hypotenuse is reciprocal to the hyptotenuse over the opposite. This means sin and cosec are recripocals of each other. Similarly cos and sec are reciprocals of each other, and tan and cot.

### Tan Sin Cos
Another important relationship is between the tan, sine and cosine. We start by finding expressions of the opposite and adjacent sides, and then substituting those into the tangent ratio. The hypotenuses cancel, and we are left with the tangent function is the sine function over the cosine function.

And with just these relationships, we can see how if we have just the sine function, we can calculate all other functions from it. The cosine is the complementary sine, the tangent is then the sine over the cosine, and the remaining three functiosn are reciprocals of the first three.

### Geometry

Finally, let's experiment with our geometry to make some additional observations about the trigonometric functions, and the relationships between them.

Let's start with just the sec and the tan, which are two sides of a right angle triangle. Now, as the secand is the hypotenuse, then it must always have a longer length than the tangent, even as the lengths get very large as we approach 90º. Also, using pythagorus with this geometry helps us come up with an equation that relate the two functions.


If we extend this geometry to a full circle, instead of just a quarter circle, we can see the sin and cosine values trace out the circle - in other words they are the x, y coordinates of the circle. Similarly, the sec and cosec values are simply the x and y intercept points of the tangent line to the circle.

Another interesting observation we can make is the sine and cosine values are limited to the range between -1 and 1. In comparison the sec and cosec go from -inf to +inf, but without ever being between -1 and 1.

Now, this isn't the only way we can draw this geometry. We can also use symmetry to form it like this.

With this geometry we can confirm the complementary nature of the funcitons, and see that when the complementary angle equals theta, when both are 45º, then so sec equals the cosec.

We can also use pythagorus to see the relationship between sine and cosine.

Also, we can see the length of the sine and the tan become more and more similar as the angle gets smaller, and the cos and cot become more similar as the angle approaches 90º.

Anyway, I encourage you to play with the geometries here to get a feeling for how the trigonometric functions are related. Doing so will also make it 





And one observation we can make is the secant line must always be longer than the tangent line, as the secant line is the hypotenuse of the triangle it makes with the tan. So even as they get larger and larger, as the angle approaches 90º, the secant is larger than the tangent.

Also, as

Firstly, the sec and the tan are two sides of a right angle triangle. This means we can use pythagorus to find the relationship directly between the two functions. It also means, that as the secant is the hypotenuse, then it will always have a longer length than the tangent.

Now, using alegbra and the geometry on the right you can express any of these ratios in terms of any other ratio. Therefore, if you know any of the ratios, you can calulate the rest from that ratio. But in this video, we will just look at some of these relationships, which if you remember will set you in good stead to derive the rest.

Firstly, three of these functions are complimentary functions



And while this is an interesting exercise, for now we will just focus the most common arrangements, which will be most useful to remember.

We start by rearranging the first two ratios to get expressions for the opposite and adjacent sides, and then substituting these into the third ratio. They hypotenuses cancel, and we see that the tan function is equal to the sin divided by the cosine.

The fourth ratio is the reciprocal of the first ratio, and so the cossec is one over the sine.

Similarly the sec is the reciprocal of the cosine, and the cot is the reciprocal of the tangent.

Finally, one more useful set of 
# Summary
So we have seen 
## Relationships
Now, there are many ways to use algebra and the geometry on the right to rearrange these ratios to be interms of any of the other ratios, but we will focus on just the few which are most common, with the understanding that you can find any of the others pretty easily.

Sor
Limits of Functions:
* Sin and cosine are a right angle trinalge where 1 is the hypotenuse, so they must always be less than 1.
* Sec and the Cosec never have magnitudes less than 1.

Relationships between functions
* Similar triangles show us 


* All complementary relationships are equal to each other with complementary angles
* sin and cosine are the coordinates of the circle
* Tan and sec are easily relatable with pythagorus
* Sec and cosec never have values between -1 and -1 - as these two ratios have hypotenuse on top and therefore are always the longest side
* Not surprisingly, at 45º, all the complementary ratios equal each other
* If you know any ratio, all others can be calculated
* The sin and tan become more similar in length near 0
* Abs(Sec) is always larger than Abs(tan)



And so these are the names we use today for each of these ratios. The names come from the relationship between right angle triangles, complementary angles and circles. This diagram not only helps us understand where the names comes from, but also helps us get an intuitive understanding of what these ratios values are, and how they are bounded.




















## Sin, Tan, Sec
Well if we take a circle with radius one, also called a unit circle, and define an arc with some angle theta, then we can draw a right angle triangle within the arc, and one outside of the arc and we can see and label some of these lines.

Firstly, we can see a line that touches the circle at one point and is perpendicular to the radius, and so is a tangent line, which we will abreviate as tan.

We can see a line that cuts through the circle, a secant line, which we will call sec.

And we can see part of a chord line. Now, using geometry you can show this is actually half of a chord, and it was called a half chord or half bowstring when these concepts were first developed in Sanskrit by Indian Mathematitians. Now our word today sine, comes from the Latin translation of this which unfortunately lost the original meaning. Maybe it would make more sense to be called a half-chord, but nevertheless, sine is the word we use and we usually abreviate this without the e.

Now, let's substitude these names into ratios where the unit circle simplifies the result.

Firstly, our inside right angle triangle has an opposite side over hypotenuse ratio equal to sin over 1, as the hypotenuse is the radius of length 1. This simplifies down to just the sine, and consequently this ratio is called the sine function.

Next, our outside right angle triangle has an opposite side over adjacent side ratio equal to tan over 1, as here the adjacent side is the radius of length 1, which in turn simplifies down to just the tan, and so this ratio is called the tan function.

Thirdly, the outside right angle trianlge has a hypotenuse over adjacent side ratio equal to sec over 1, resulting in this ratio being called the sec function.

## Cos, Cot, Csc
Now, we are going to construct inside and outside right angle triangles around the complementary angle of theta.

These triangles 

The names of our three remaining ratios come from the similar triangles created from the complementary angle of theta.

So, we start with our complementary angle, and construct our inside and outside triangles.

This means we have a tangent of the complmentary angle

Now if we look at our remaining ratios, we can see each one is just a reciprocal of one we've already named, nevertheless they all have individual names, and all these names come from the concept of a complementary angle





# RESET from Sin, Tan, Sec
Well we start by taking a circle with radius one, also called a unit circle, and define an arc with some angle theta, around which we can draw a right angle triangle.

## Tan, sec

Now, the side opposite theta of this right angle triangle is a tangent line, so we will call it tan. The hypotenuse cuts through the circle, so its a secant line, that we will call sec, and our adjacent side is the radius, which is 1.

Let's now rewrite all of our ratios in terms of these sides. So the opposite side over the hypotenuse is tan over sec. The adjacent side over hypotenuse is 1 over sec. The opposite side over the adjacent side is then tan over 1, which just simplifies down to tan, and we can continue to fill out our ratios.

## Sin, Cosine
Ok great.

Now we draw a right angle triangle within the arc. This triangle also has an angle theta and is thus similar to our first triangle and all its side ratios will be the same.

The side opposite theta is a part of a chord line, and in fact using geometry you can show this is actually half of a chord, and as such it was called a half chord or half bowstring when these concepts were first developed in Sanskrit by Indian Mathematitians. Now our word for this line today sine, comes from the Latin translation of the concept which unfortunately lost the original meaning. Nevertheless, sine comes from the word for half-chord and is the word we use today, though ofen we abreviate it without the e.

Next, we can recognize that the adjacent side to theta, is actually the side opposite theta's complementary angle. We can therefore say this is the sine of the complementary angle, which we then call complimentary sine of theta, which we abbreviate to cosine or cos.

Finally the hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius 1, so we can now write all our ratios in terms of these sides.

So opposite over hypotenuse is sine over 1 which simplifies down to sin. Adjacent over hypotenuse is then cos over one or just cos. And we can go ahead and fill out the remainder of the ratios.

## Cot, Cosec

Now finally we construct a third right angle triangle, but this time around the arc of the circle that covers theta's complementary angle.

Once again we have a tangent line, but in this case it's the tangent of the complimentary angle, which we cal the complimenetary tangent, cotangent, or cot for short.

We also have a secant line of the the complementary angle which we will call the complimentary secant, cosec or csc for short. And our third line is the radius 1.

Now, this right angle triangle is also similar to our first two right angle triangles because it also has the theta as well.

So let's do the same exercise and substitute our sides into the ratios, being careful to use the sides relative to theta and not the complementary angle.

## Summary
Now we have a whole bunch of different expressions for the 6 different side ratios of a right angle triangle. In fact, we could make a lot more expressions using substitution and the pythagorean theorem. But most commonly, we usually remember just a few of these, and understand we can derive the rest from them. So let's remove some of the less common ratios, and we are left with

The sine is the opposite over the hypotenuse, the cosine is the adjacent over the hypotenuse, the tangent is the opposite over the adjacent, and is often useful to remember it can be a function of the sine and cosine. The cosec, sec and cot are then the reciprocals of the sin, cosine and tangent.






# RESET
So how do these lines relate to the ratios in a triangle?

We start with a quarter circle of radius 1, around which we construct a right angle triangle such that the hypotenuse is tangent to the circle, and touches the circle at some angle theta.

Now, we have two right angle triangles, and using complementary angles, we can show that the top angle is also angle theta, meaning both right angle triangles are similar and have the same corresponding side ratios.

Also, because the triangles have a side length equal to one, some of those ratios will have a 1 in their denominator, simplifying them down to a single side.

So now, let's name our sides relative to theta.

Firstly, we will call side that covers or subtends theta in the first triangle the tangent, or just tan. The third line of this triangle is a secant line that cuts through the circle, so we call it the sec.

Let's now fill in our opposite over ajcent ratio. The side opposite theta is the tan line, whose length is a function of theta, and the adjacent side is 1.

Similarly, we can see our hypotenuse over adjacent is the sec line over one, where the sec length is also a function of theta, leaving us with just the sec.

And in fact, these two ratios are most often called the tan function and sec function.

Let's now look at our second triangle.

This triangle also has a tangent line, but this time it covers the complementary angle. Therefore we will call it the complementary tangent, cotangent or cot for short.

Similarly the we have a complimentary secant line, which we call the cosec or csc for short.

We can now fill in two more ratios, being careful to fill them in relative to theta and not the complementary angle, so the side adjacent to theta over the opposite side is equal to the cot, whose lenght is a function of theta over 1, or simply the cot, and the hypotenuse over the opposite is the cosec.

Now our final two ratios have the hypotenuse as the denominator so we need to construct a similar right angle triangle with the radius as the hypotenuse. Now this line is a half cord line, and in fact when these ratios were developed it was called the half chord or half bowstring. However, as the concept was translated into Latin, the original meaning was lost, and the Latin word sinus meaning bay or bossom was used to describe this line. As a result our word today is the sine, or sin comes from this. But we can think of it as a half cord as that is what it is.

So now our opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the sine, whose length is a function of theta, over one or just the sine.

Finally, we will draw the sine of the complementary angle, which we will call the cosine or cos for short. And with it, we see our last ratio is simply the cos.

And so these are the names we use today for each of these ratios. The names come from the relationship between right angle triangles, complementary angles and circles. This diagram not only helps us understand where the names comes from, but also helps us get an intuitive understanding of what these ratios values are, and how they are bounded.







So let's name our sides relative to the angle theta. First we will name the tangent line that subtends the angle theta, tan (from tangent). And the

Now our second triangle also has a tangent line, but it covers the complementary angle, so we will call it the complementary tan, or cotan or cot for short. And our final line is the complementary secant line, or which we call the cosec or csc.














# From before


# Where we are going
This video is going to build up to this geometry which shows the relationship between the trigonometric functions. You can move the radius and see how the length of the lines which corresponds with teh value of the functions change, and hopefully draw out some insights that are in there in the mathematics, but maybe not quite as tangible as when you see and play with a diagram that shows them.

In this video, we will build up this diagram that relates the trigonometric functions. Along the way we will see why the trigonometric functions exist, where their names come from and then use this diagram to get insights into the relationships between the functions. YOu can get the same insights from looking at the math of the relationships, but for some, like myself, different insights pop out in different ways. Interacting with this diagram make it obvious to me that the sec and cosec cannot exist between -1 and 1. For instance, using this diagram you can see that the cosine and sine are limited to within + and minus 1. In contrast the sec and cosec can be any value between -inf and +inf except between + and minus 1. Such insights are clear from the math, but studying the 

# Similar Triangles
*Really drive home the last point*
We first need to review properties of similar triangles.

Two triangles are similar when they have the same set of angles, and have corresponding side lengths that are scaled by the same factor. This then helps us understand a third property, which is the ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles will be equal. So if we take the ratio of sides sA and sB from the bottom triangle, the s term cancels and we are left with the same ratio as sides A and B from the top triangle. These properties are a consequence of each other, and so triangles with any of these properties will have all of these properties and be similar.

# Right Angle Triangles
The trigonometric functions come from studying the relationship between sides and angles in a right angle triangle.

So what does this mean for right angle triangles?

Well, by definition as we know one angle is a right angle, when we define one more angle theta, then because angles in a triangle always add to 180º, we are effectively defining all three angles.

So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta have the same set of angles.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will be similar.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios.
