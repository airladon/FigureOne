When first learned, the trigonometric function abreviations may seem arbitrary, but in fact they come from the relationship between right angle triangles and circles.

We start with the first quadrant of a circle, and note the x and y coordinates of each point on a circle can be expressed with a right angle triangle.

When we use a unit circle, the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle is one, and the two trigonometric ratios with hypotenuse in the denominator will have denominators of 1 and simpify down to just the x and y coordinates. And so the names of these sides will be the names of the trigonometric functions.

Now a line between any two points on a circle is called a *chord* line where the word *chord* comes from the Latin word meaning *bowstring*. The vertical line of the triangle is then a half chord, and so the opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the half chord over one, or just the half chord. In fact, originally in Sanskrit this ratio was called just that, a half chord or half bowstring, but when it was later translated into Latin it lost this meaning. Our word for this ratio today, sine, comes from this Latin translation, though we often abreviate it without the e.

Note here that as we change theta, the length of the sine line changes, and so the sine is a function of theta, and we might say this line is the sine of angle theta.

So if the sine of an angle is the side opposite the angle over the hypotenuse, and our horizontal side is opposite the complementary angle, then we can say the side is the sine of the complementary angle of theta. Therefore, we call this side the complementary sine, the cosine or just cos for short. Relative to theta, the ratio of the adjacent side over the hypotenuse is the cos over one, or just the cosine and so this ratio is called the cosine.

Ok, we've named our first two trigonometric functions by using a right angle triangle with side length one, and then naming the other two sides.

We can do the same thing for the remaining ratios.

Let's start by growing the triangle so that the side adjacent to theta becomes one. Now, a line that *touches* the circle at one point, and is perpendicular to the radius line at the same point, is called a *tangent* line, where the word tangent comes from the latin word meaning *to touch*.

Our opposite side is a tangent line, and we call it the tan for short. This means the ratio opposite over adjacent is the tan over one or just the tan.

Next, a line that *cuts* through the circle is called a *secant* line, where the word secant comes from the latin word meaning *to cut*. In this case our hypotenuse is a secant line and so we call it the sec for short. And so the hypotenuse over adjacent ratio is the sec over one or just the sec.

Let's now find our last two ratio names by growing the triangle again so that the opposite side is one.

Similar to the cosine, we now use the complementary angle to name our last two ratios. The complementary angle's adjacent side is one,  the opposite side is the horizontal line, and we know the opposite over adjacent is the tan, so we can say the horizontal line is the tangent of the compelmentary angle. We call this the complementary tangent, cotangent, cotan or just cot for short. Relative to theta then, the adjacent side over the opposite is the cot over one or just the cot.

Similarly as the complementary's angle's adjacent side is one, then the hypotenuse over the adjacent is the secant of the complementary angle, which we call the complementary secant, cosecant, cosec or just csc. Related to theta, the hypotenuse over the opposite is the csc over 1 or just the csc.

With this, we have the names of all the trigonometric functions.

Note also, in naming our functions we've also found three complimentary relationships between the trigonometric functions. We've found the sine of the complementary angle of theta is the cosine of theta. We can similarly show the cosine of the complementary angle is the sine of the theta.

Similarly we seen the sec...
