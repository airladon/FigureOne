When first learned, the trigonometric function abreviations may seem strange. In fact they come from the relationship between right angle triangles and circles.

We start with the first quadrant of a circle, and note the x and y coordinates of each point on the circle can be expressed with a right angle triangle.

When we use a *unit circle*, the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle is one, and the two trigonometric ratios with hypotenuse in the denominator will have denominators of 1 and simpify down to just the length of the triangle's sides. The the names of these sides will be the names of the trigonometric functions.

Now a line between any two points on a circle is called a *chord* line where the word *chord* comes from the Latin word meaning *bowstring*. The vertical line of the triangle, which represents the opposite over hypotenuse ratio, is then a half chord, and in fact, originally in Sanskrit it was called just that, a half chord or half bowstring, but when it was later translated into Latin it lost this meaning. Our word for this ratio today, sine, comes from this Latin translation, though we often abreviate it without the e.

Therefore, the opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the sine function over 1, or just the sine function.

So if the sine of an angle is *opposite* the angle, and our horizontal side is opposite the complementary angle, then we can say the horiztonal side is the *sine of the complementary angle of theta*. Therefore, we call this side the complementary sine, the cosine or just cos for short. Relative to theta, the ratio of the adjacent side over the hypotenuse is then the cosine function.

Ok, we've named our first two trigonometric functions by using a right angle triangle with side length one, and then naming the other two sides.

We will do something similar for the remaining ratios.

Let's start by growing the triangle so that the side adjacent to theta becomes one. Now, a line that *touches* the circle at one point, and is perpendicular to the radius line at the same point, is called a *tangent* line, where the word tangent comes from the latin word meaning *to touch*.

Our opposite side is a tangent line, and we call it the tan for short.

Next, a line that *cuts* through the circle is called a *secant* line, where the word secant comes from the latin word meaning *to cut*. In this case our hypotenuse is a secant line and so we call it the sec for short.

And so the ratio of opposite over adjacent is the tan function, and the ratio hypotenuse over adjacent is the sec function.

Let's now find our last two ratio names by growing the triangle again so that now the *opposite* side is one.

Now this triangle is similar to our tan sec triangle in that is has a side, that isn't the hypotenuse, of length one, but now it is adjacent to the *complementary angle*. Therefore the side opposite the complimentary angle is the tangent of the complementary angle, and so we call this the complementary tangent, cotangent, cotan or just cot for short. 

Similarly, the hypotenuse over the adjacent is the secant of the complementary angle, which we call the complementary secant, cosecant, cosec or just csc.

Relative to theta then, the adjacent side over the opposite is the cot function, and the hypotenuse over the opposite is the cosec or csc function.

And so we can see where the trigonometric function names come from. The sin, tan and sec names come from lines associated with circles, while the cosine, cotan and cosec names describe the complementary relationship with the sine, tan and sec functions.

Note also, in naming our functions we've also found three complimentary relationships between the trigonometric functions. We've found the sine of the complementary angle of theta is the cosine of theta. We can similarly show the cosine of the complementary angle is the sine of the theta.

Similarly we seen the sec...
