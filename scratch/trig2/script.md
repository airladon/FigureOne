* This triangle is interactive. You can drag the top corner or rotate the hypotenuse to make different triangles. When you interact with it, the video will pause, so press play when you're ready to continue.


* Now as we change the triangle, let's look at the all the possible side ratio values.

* Try making different triangles and see how the ratios change. Can you find a way to change the triangle that keeps the ratios constant?

* Well, if we are careful and change the size of the triangle without changing the angle theta, we can see the ratios stay constant.
* This seems to work for any angle, like small angles... and large angles.

* Why is this?


* Well, we might remember from geometry, that a triangle's angles sum to 180ยบ, so when we define two angles, in this case the right angle and theta, we are really defining all three.

* Therefore all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have the same set of angles and be similar triangles.

* Now, a property of similar triangles is that all similar triangles will have equal corresponding side ratios.
>> So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios. 
* So for example if we label two sides on the left triangle, and take their ratio, then the corresponding sides of the right triangle will have the same ratio. Similarly, if we label the third side, the ratio between the first and third sides will be the same for both triangles, and this holds for any side ratio.

* So this explains why all the ratios stay constant when the angle stays the same, even if the triangle size changes.

* In fact, we can see the ratios *only* change when we change the angle - and therefore we can say the ratios are dependent on, or a function of angle, which we've called theta.

* These functions are used frequently in trigonometry, and so they each have a special abreviated name - the sin, cos, tan, sec, csc and cot, and as a collection they are often called trigonometric functions.

* The next video in this series will show where these names come from.

The trigonometric function names come from the relationship between right angle triangles and circles.

We start with a unit circle, a circle with radius 1, and notethe x and y coordinates of each point on a circle can be expressed with the perpendicular sides of a right angle triangle.

As the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle is one, then the two trigonometric ratios with hypotenuse in the denominator will simpify down to just the x and y coordinates.

Now a line between any two points on a circle is called a *chord* line where the word *chord* comes from the Latin word meaning *bowstring*. The vertical line of the triangle is then a half chord, and so the opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the half chord over one, or just the half chord. In fact, originally in Sanskrit this ratio was called just that, a half chord or half bowstring, but when it was later translated into Latin it lost this meaning. Our word for this ratio today, sine, comes from this Latin translation, though we often abreviate it without the e.

Note here that as we change theta, the length of the sine line changes, and so the sine is a function of theta, and we might say this line is the sine of angle theta.

So if the sine of an angle is the side opposite the angle over the hypotenuse, and our horizontal side is opposite the complementary angle, then we can say the side is the sine of the complementary angle of theta. Therefore, we call this side the complementary sine, the cosine or just cos for short. Relative to theta, the ratio of the adjacent side over the hypotenuse is the cos over one, or just the cosine and so this ratio is called the cosine.

Ok, we've named our first two trigonometric functions by using a right angle triangle with side length one, and then naming the other two sides.

We can do the same thing for the remaining ratios.

Let's start by growing the triangle so that the side adjacent to theta becomes one. Now, a line that *touches* the circle at one point, and is perpendicular to the radius line at the same point, is called a *tangent* line, where the word tangent comes from the latin word meaning *to touch*.

Our opposite side is a tangent line, and we call it the tan for short. This means the ratio opposite over adjacent is the tan over one or just the tan.

Next, a line that *cuts* through the circle is called a *secant* line, where the word secant comes from the latin word meaning *to cut*. In this case our hypotenuse is a secant line and so we call it the sec for short. And so the hypotenuse over adjacent ratio is the sec over one or just the sec.

Let's now find our last two ratio names by growing the triangle again so that the opposite side is one.

Similar to the cosine, we now use the complementary angle to name our last two ratios. The complementary angle's adjacent side is one,  the opposite side is the horizontal line, and we know the opposite over adjacent is the tan, so we can say the horizontal line is the tangent of the compelmentary angle. We call this the complementary tangent, cotangent, cotan or just cot for short. Relative to theta then, the adjacent side over the opposite is the cot over one or just the cot.

Similarly as the complementary's angle's adjacent side is one, then the hypotenuse over the adjacent is the secant of the complementary angle, which we call the complementary secant, cosecant, cosec or just csc. Related to theta, the hypotenuse over the opposite is the csc over 1 or just the csc.

With this, we have the names of all the trigonometric functions.



>> show a triangle with sin, cosine, theta and comp
Note also, in naming our functions we've also found three complimentary relationships between the trigonometric functions. We've found the sine of the complementary angle of theta is the cosine of theta. We can similarly show the cosine of the complementary angle is the sine of the theta.

Similarly we seen the sec...

Video 3 - Relationships
> start with three separate similar triangles
In the last video, we named the trigonometric functions using three similar triangles with angle theta, each with a side length of 1 in a different position relative to theta.

> combine to all similar triangles share the same angle theta
> Show tan = sin / cos, cot = 1 / tan
> sec = 1 / cos, csc = 1 / sin
> Show pythagorus cos + sin = 1, tan + 1 = sec, cot + 1 = csc
When we combine these three triangles into geometry that contains all the trigonometric functions, we can gain insight into some of the relationships between the trigonometric functions.

The diagrams in this video are interactive. So when you see me interacting with an element, like this line here for instance, then you can too. When you do, the video will pause, so press play when you're ready to continue.

> rotate cot triangle to cover complementary angle
>See when csc = sec at 45ยบ

> flip and rotate triangles to make one large right angle triangle
> cot + tan = sec + csc



Video 4 - extending the trigonometric functions beyond 0 to 90ยบ













When you first learn the six trigonometric function abreviations, it is usually not obvious where they have come from.

>> In fact, three of the abreviations come from the names of three different lines related to a circle, while the remaining three names come from combining the word complimentary angle with the first three names. Let's see why.

>The trigonometric functions are named after three lines related to circles.

> Right angle triangles can be used to analyze various points, lines and geometries associated with circles. In three cases, the side of a right angle triangle is same value as a trigonometric function, and it will be closely related to a well known circle line.

The relationships between right angle triangles, circles and geometries related to circles have been studied for millenia. Some right angle triangles 

>> Show cos/sin right triangle, then kite right triangles, then polygon inside right triangle. Name polygon side half-side, equating to sine
* Right angle triangles are commonly used to analyze various points, lines and geometries associated with circles. In three special situations the right angle triangle has a side length that *has the same value* as the trigonometric function, and is a well known line related to a circle, and as a result the function is named after that line. In other cases, the trigonometric function name comes from applying a named trigonometric function to the complementary angle in the triangle.

>> show tangent triangle, then dissolve in outside polygon, and outside kit
* Take for example this triangle, which you might find in numerous geometries. When the circle has radius 1, or when it is a unit circle, then the ratios with the adjacent side in the denominator will will simplify. So, what are do we call these side lengths then?

* Well a line that *touches* the circle at one point, and is perpendicular to the radius line at the same point, is called a *tangent* line, where the word tangent comes from the latin word meaning *to touch*. The line opposite theta is a tangent line, and we will call it just tan for short. The tan line is a function of theta, as when we change theta the length changes, but for simplicity, we will leave theta off.

* Next, a line that *cuts* through the circle is called a *secant* line, where the word secant comes from the latin word meaning *to cut*.

* And so we call the line that cuts through the circle to the tan line the secant, or just sec for short, remembering the sec is also a function of theta.

* And so our two trigonometric ratios with adjacent in the bottom are the tan and sec functions.

* Now, what if we change the size of this triangle such that the side opposite theta becomes 1, instead of the side adjacent. The length of the horizontal side is now the tangent of the complementary angle, which we can call the complementary tangent of theta, cotangent, cotan or just cot.

* Similarly the hypotenuse is the secant of the complementary angle, and so we call it the complementary secant of theta, cosecant, cosec or just csc.

>> To find the remaning functions, we need to find other right angle triangles where the hypotenuse and then the opposite side is 1.

* Next, let's look at a right angle triangle within the circle. This right angle triangle can be used to analyze a *chord* line, where the word *chord* comes from the Latin word meaning *bowstring*. This means the vertical line of the triangle is a half chord, and while originally in Sanskrit it was called just that, a half chord or half bowstring, it was later translated into Latin where it lost this meaning. Our word today sine, comes from this Latin translation, though we often abreviate it without the e.

* As such, the side ratio opposite over hypotenuse is the sine over one, or just the sine function.

* The horizontal side is then the sine of the complementary angle of theta. In terms of theta, we call it the complimentary sine of theta, cosine or just cos for short.

* And this gives us the name of the side ratio adjacent over the hypotenuse.

*


our word sine comes from the Latin translation that lost this meaning. And so we can label our side the sin, where we often abreviate it without the e.
