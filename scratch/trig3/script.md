In the last video, we named the trigonometric functions using three similar triangles with unit length sides as the hypotenuse, side adjacent to theta and side opposite theta.

Now, we will use these triangles to find some relationships between the trigonometric functions.

This video is interactive. That means when you see me interacting with an element on the screen, then you can to. When you do so, the video will pause, so press play when you're ready to continue.

Now, for our first relationships we can recognize that as each triangle is a right angle triangle, then each triangle's sides can be related using pythagorus. So for the sin, cos triangle, the square of the hyptoneuse is the sum of the squares of the sine and cosine. Similarly we can find the relationship between the tan, sec and one, and the cot, csc and one.

Next, as all of these triangles share the same angles, then they are similar and so there corresponding side ratios are equal. Therefore, if we take the opposite over the adjacent ratio for the sin, cos and tan sec triangles we see the common relationship that the tan is equal to the sin over the cosine.

We can use this logic to find a multitude of other relationships between side ratios. Two other common examples are, the hyptoneuse over one gives us one over cos equals sec, and one over sine equals csc.

Next, let's line up the sin cos triangle with a circle. So we can put the tan and cot triangles to the side, and show a quarter circle, and we can see that 


Now, let's start interacting. First, we can change our angle theta with the angle in the bottom left corner here.

First, we can move triangles by dragging them. When we touch them, some options for the specific triangle show up on the left here, and we will cover them as we need them, but by all means experiment with them now if you wish.

So let's drag the cot triangle off the screen and compare the remaining two. To make it cleaner, we will hide the unit sides with this button for each triangle.



This video is interactive. When you see me interacting with an element, like this triangle here, then you can too. When you do, the video will pause, so press play when you're ready to continue.

In this diagram, you can change the angle theta of all triangles by changing the angle here in the bottom left corner.

You can also move a triangle by dragging it, or rotate it by draggin its corner.

When you touch a triangle, some commands and properties specific to that triangle are shown on the left here. Now, when we change theta, the size of the triangle changes, but we can lock the positions of angles and sides using these two lock buttons. Currently our theta angle is locked, so when we change the angle, the theta vertex stays int eh same position. If we change it to lock the right angle, then it will stay in the same position, and similarly we can lock the complementary angle.

Also, by default the perpendicular side next to the locked angle is locked in position, but we can change it so the hypotenuse is locked.


In the last video, we saw how the trigonometric functions were named by using three similar triangles, each with a side length of 1 at a different position relative to theta - so we have a unit side as the hypotenuse, the side adjacent to theta, and the side opposite.

Now, looking at these triangles togeter is kind of interesting, as we can arrange them in different geometries that gives us some insight into their relationships.

For instance, one of the more common ones is this one that 

Draggin the angle in the bottom corner here changes the angle theta.
Now, each triangle can be moved by touching and dragging it from the middle, or if you touch its corners you can rotate it. When you touch a triangle, it will be selected, and specific actions or properties for that triangle show up on the left here.

For instance, you can flip the triangle.
Now, if we look at all these triangles together, we might be able to get a more intuitive feel for how these functions are related, and at the same time find actualy relationships between them that you can also find in the math, but might not be quite as obvious.

If you change this angle here in the bottom left, then you can see how all the triangles change. The reset button here will put the triangles back in their original state.

Now, this diagram gets interesting when we arrange the triangles relative to each other. For instance, let's drag the trianlges on top of each other so the theta angles align.

This is nice, but it ca
