Welcome to this interactive video, introducing where the trigonometric functions come from. This video is interactive, so if you see me interacting with an element on the screen, such as this sec line here, then you can to. When you do, the video will pause, so press play when you're ready to continue.

To understand the trigonometric functions we apply the study of similar triangles to right angle triangles, and so we're going to start by reviewing two properties of similar triangles.
* The first is any triangles that have the same set of angles, are similar triangles.
* The second is similar triangles have equal corresponding side ratios. So for example the ratio of the sides around the green angle here is constant for all similar triangles, as is the ratio for the sides around the red angle, or the blue angle.
* So, let's apply this to right angle trianlges. A right angle triangle has a right angle, and so when we define an angle theta, we effectively define all three angles as their sum is always 180º.
* So All right angle triangles with the same angle theta have the same set of angles and are thus similar
* Meaning all right angle triangles with angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios

* Ok, so let's develop this, by *naming* the sides relative to theta, listing out all the possible *side ratios*, and then exploring their *values* for different triangles. This diagram is interactive and you can drag the *top corner* of the triangle, to look at the *different ratios* for *different triangles*. Now if you're careful, and try and *keep theta constant* you can see that the *ratios stay constant*, as we just showed they should as a constant theta means the triangles are similar. If on the other hand you *change the angle* by moving the hypotenuse, you can see the *ratios change*, and so we can say the ratios are *dependant on*, or a *function of* theta. They are not a function of the triangle size, just a function of theta.
* These functions are the trigonometric functions, and they each have a commonly used abbreviated name - sin cos tan csc sec and cot. Now where do these names come from? Well they come from the relationship between right angle triangles and circles. Right angle triangles can be used to analyze many lines and geometries associated with circles, but when some of these lines are analyzed, they end up having the same value as a trigonometric function, and as a result, the trigonometric function is named after them.

* To see this, we start with a *point* on a *unit circle* that has a radius line at some angle *theta* to the x axis. Now a line that *touches* the circle at one point, and is perpendicular to the radius line at the same point, is called a *tangent* line, where the word tangent comes from the latin word meaning *to touch*. We can draw a tangent line on our diagram that extends up to the angle theta, and call it the tangent or tan for short. It's length changes with theta, and so its a function of theta, but we will leave theta off to keep the diagram clean.
* Next, a line that *cuts* through the circle is called a *secant* line, where the word secant comes from the latin word meaning *to cut*.
* And so we call the line that cuts through the circle to the tan line the secant, or just sec for short, remembering the sec is also a function of theta.
* And now we have a right angle triangle with sides tan, sec and length 1.

* Our next triangle is inside the circle, and its side names come from the line between any two points on a circle, which is called a *chord* line where the word *chord* comes from the Latin word meaning *bowstring*.
* The vertical line of this triangle is then a half chord, and while originally in Sanskrit it was called just that, a half chord or half bowstring, our word sine comes from the Latin translation that lost this meaning. And so we can label our side the sin, where we often abreviate it without the e.
* Next, we can see the horizontal side of this triangle is the *sine* of the *complimentary angle of theta*, and so we call it the *complementary sine of theta*, *cosine* or just the *cos*.
* And that gives us our second triangle with sides sin, cos and length 1.

* Our third and last triangle then will be the *same as our first*, but for the *complementary angle of theta*.
* So the top horizontal line is the tangent of the complementary angle, which we call the complementary tangent, cotangent, cotan or just cot.
* And the hypotenuse is the secant of the complementary angle, which we call the complimentary secant, cosecant, cosec or just csc.

* Now, here we have *three right angle triangles*, all with the *same angle theta*, and all with a *side length of 1* that is in a different *position relative to theta*. So we have a unit side length that is the hypotenuse, the opposite side, and the adjacent side. We also have two ratios with hypotenuse in the denominator, opposite in the denomonimator and adjacent in the deonominator. This means, each triangle will have two ratios where the denominator is one, and the resulting ratio is simply the side in the numerator.
* Also, as these triangles have the same angle theta, then they are similar, and their corresponding side ratios are all equal, and so we can equate them.

* For the first ratio of the first triangle, the opposite side is the sine function, and the hypotenuse is one, and so our ratio is sine over one or just the sine function. 
* Our second ratio then, the adjacent over the hypotenuse, is the cosine over one or just the cosine function. Our third ratio is the sine over the cosine and we can continue to fill in the remaining ratios.
* Now, as we said, each triangle is similar, so we can equate the ratios of the first triangle to the second, and then do the same for the third triangle.
* And so each ratio here has an expression that is one of our named sides, and so that is the name we give the associated trigonometric function.
* This exercise has also resulted in a bunch of relationships, however we don't have to worry about remembering them all as with just one relationship for each function, we can pretty easily derive the others, and so we will *keep* just one *key relationship* for each.

* Now, thus far we've defined the trigonmetric functions as the different side ratios of a right angle triangle with some angle theta, but in a right angle triangle, the angle theta can only have values betwen 0 and 90 degrees, and so our functions are similarly limited.
* Next then, we can extend the functions to operate on more angles by expanding this geometry to include the *full* unit circle and note that in the first quadrant, the cosine and sine of angle theta are the x and y coordinates of the point on the circle at theta.

* So, instead of defining the cosine and sine as the side ratios of a triangle, we can define them as the x, y coordinates of all points on a unit circle. This doesn't change the functions in the first quadrant, and they still represent the side ratios of right angle triangles, but it means now we can use angles greater than 90º and less than 0º in the cosine and sine functions.
* What's more, as our remaining trigonometric functions can be expressed in terms of the cosine and sine, then we can similarly extend *their* definitions to all other angles as well.
* So let's use the symmetry of a circle, to find the relationship between the cosine and sine values of theta in different quadrants.
* For instance, if we mirror a point in the first quadrant, around the y axis, we can see the mirrored point has an angle of 180º minus theta, and it has the same y coordinate, but negative x coordinate of the original point.
* And so we can say the sine of 180º minus theta is equal to the sine of theta, and the cosine of 180º minus theta is the negative of cosine theta.
* We can do a similar exercise for the third quadrant, but this time mirror the point around the y and x axes. The new point is at 180º + theta, and the sine and cosine functions are both the negatives of the first quadrant, and so we can say the sine of 180º + theta equals negative sine theta, and the cosine of 180º + theta equals negative cosine theta.
* Finally we can mirror the point around the x axis into the fourth quadrant, where the angle will be 360º - theta. We can see the sine in this quadrant is equal to the negative of the sine in the first quadrant and the cosine in this quadrant is the same as the cosine in the first quadrant. Now 360º minus theta is the same as rotating in the opposite direction, and so we can subsitute negative theta into these relationships as well.
* Now, we can plug these relationships into any of the remaining trigonometric functions to similarly extend them. For example, we can find the tan of theta in the fourth quadrant by substituting in negative theta into the tan function, we know sin negative theta is negative sine theta, and cosine of negative theta is cosine theta, and so tan of negative theta is negative tan theta.

* Now let's go back to our geometry, and play around with it to tease out a few more useful relationships between the trigonometric functions.
* This diagram is also interactive, and we can move the sec and cosec lines to change the angle theta, and touch the expressions to the left to turn on and off different lines.
* If we start by focusing on the sine and cosine again, we can see they are two sides of a right angle triangle, and therefore can be related by pythagorus.
* In comparison, the tan and sec are also two sides of a right angle triangle, but as this time the unit side is not the hypotenuse, the relationship is a little different.
* Focusing on just the sine and tan, we can see as the angle theta gets smaller, the lengths of the sine, tan and arc between them become more and more similar. This leads to a limit that has many uses especially in calculus.
* Now, this geometry isn't the only geometry that conveniently relates the trigonometric functions, and we can see a similar one by flipping and rotating some of the triangles.
* This geometry is nice as it more clearly shows the tan and the cot combine to form a tangent line that covers the entire quadrant, and it separates out the sec and csc lines, making it both easier to see them, as well as easier to see their values by reading them directly from the x and y axes.
* Let's finish by noting the bounds of each function.
* As the cosine and sine are the coordinates of the unit circle, their bounds must be between -1 and 1.
* The Tan and Cot then can have bounds between -inifity to +positive infinity
* And the Sec and Cosec can be any value between negative inifinity to positive infinity but not between negative one and one.
* Ok, so we have covered where the trigonometric functions come from and why they apply to all right angle triangles, and we've seen two geometries that have helped us name the functions, see a number of relationships between them, and helped us bound their values. So we are going to stop here, but remember, many of the diagrams in the video were interactive, so if you forgot to do so during the video, go back and play with them now, and doing so may help you get a more intuitive understanding of the various things discussed.

* This leads us to 

* So now if we go back to our circle geometry, our cosine and sine of the x and y coordinates of a unit circle, the tan and cot
* Let's now add back our lines to our geometry, and find a few more relationships between the trigonometric functions.
* Firstly, looking a

* So what is the values 
In the first quadrant, the functions have not changed, and can still represent the side ratios of a triangle, but in the second third and fourth quadrants, their values may become negative.
* Also, if we can find the cosine and sine values for 
* Therefore, if we extend our definition of the cosine and sine to be any point on the circle in any quadrant, it remains the same
,utilizing the symmetry of the circle, and and recognizing that the sine and cosine are the x and y coordinates of each point on the unit circle in the first quadrant, and that all trigonometric function values can be calculated from the sine and cosine terms.

* Now, this geometry we've constructed can visually show us some additional relationships between the trigonmetric functions. To explore these, we can move the sec or cosec lines to change angle theta, and touch the various functions on the left to toggle the lines on the diagram.
* To start with, if we turn off the lines other than the sine and cosine, we can quickly see that the sine and cosine are two sides of a right angle triangle and can thus be related with Pythagorus. We can do the same exercise with the Tan and Sec, or Cot and CSC, though the expressions are a little different as the unit side is no longer the hypotenuse.
* We can also see that as we reduce the angle theta, the sine, tan and arc length all approach the same value, and with analysis we would find limits that are used extensively in calculuse.
* Next, let's extend this geometry to a full circle.
* Ok, so far we've defined our trigonometric functions as the different side ratios of a right angle triangle with some angle theta, but the angle theta can only be between 0 and 90º for a right angle triangle, and so our trigonmetric functions are also limited to the same range.
* Now, if we examine our sine and cosine functions, we can see they represent the x and y coordinates of the point on the circle.
> And now let's simplify this down to just one relationship per function.
> And we are left with a number of relationships between the trigonometric functions - but you don't need to remember them all. In fact, you just remember a small portion, you can derive the rest relatively easily. Firstly, we can identify
> Each ratio has an expression that it is equal to one of our named sides, and these are the names of the trigonometric functions.
> We also have two columns of relationships between functions, which for now we will pair down to just those that are most convenient to remember, as all others can be derived from them.
Now in addition to showing us where the names of our trigonemtric functions come from, this geometry can also be used to show other common relationships between the functions that we haven't seen yet, as well as give us some idea about how the functions are bounded.

To do so, we can change this geometry by moving the sec or cosec lines, and touching any of the expressions on the left here to turn on and off the lines.

So for example, if we focus on just the sine and cosine functions, we can see they are two sides of a right angle triangle and so we can use pythagorus to relate them. Also, as the hyptoentuse is 1, and must always be longer than the other sides we can say the sine and cosine lengths can never be larger than 1.

Now what about the Tan and Sec? Well let's see by turning off the sine and cosine and turning on the tan and sec. They also form a right angle triangle, but this time the Sec is the hypotenuse so their relationship is slightly different. Also, because the sec is the hypotenuse, we can see that its length must always be longer than the tan.

Another common relatipnship we can see with this geometry is between the sine and the tan. As our angle get's smaller, the sine, the tan and the arc between them all approach the same length. This leads to a well known, very useful limit used extensively in calculus.

Now, let's find an angle where two functions have the same length. Maybe most easy to see is the sec and cosec are equal at 45º. This makes sense remembering the cosec is the sec of the complementary angle, and we can expect similar for the other complimentary pairs - the sine and cosine and tan and cot.


Ok, we can now extend this geometry out to a full circle, and then flip and rotate some of the similar triangles to see a different form of the geometry. Now, this geometry separates the sec and the cosec lines, making them easier to see, it shows how the tan and cot lines combine to form a tangent line that subtends, or covers the entire quadrant.

And it can also help us extend the trigonometric functions for theta values beyond 0 to 90º. To do this, lets look at just the sine and the cosine, and as we rotate the unit radius within the first quadrant, we can see the x and y coordinates of points on the circle equal the cosine and sine functions. But our cosine and sine definitions come from side ratios of a right angle triangle, and so are limited to theta values between 0 and 90º. Therefore if instead we say the cosine and sine functions are defined by the x and y coordinates of points on a unit circle, this is still consistent with right angle triangles in the first quadrant, but allows us to use these functions for angles outside of 0º to 90º.

>Now our sine and consine functions have been defined as the ratios of sides of a right angle triangle, but if instead we say the sine and cosine functions are the x and y coordinates of a circle, it is still consistent with the right angle triangle definition, but extends the 

>Now if we change our definitions around and say the cosine and sine functions come from x and y coordinates of points on the circle instead of just the ratios of a triangles sides, then we can define sine and cosine for theta values greater than 90º.

Let's start by finding the sine and cosine values for angles within the second quardant by mirroring any point on the circle in the first quadrant around the y axis. The mirrored point is at an angle of 180º minus theta, and it has the same y coordinate but negative x coordinate of the original point.

And so we can say the sine of 180º minus theta is equal to the sine of theta, and the cosine of 180º minus theta is the negative of cosine theta. These two relationships will hold for any theta, but we can use them to calculate the sine and cosine of any angle in the second quadrant.

We can do a similar exercise for the third quadrant, but this time mirror the point around the y and x axes. The new points is at 180º + theta, and the sine and cosine functions are both the negatives of the first quadrant, and so we can say the sine of 180º + theta equals negative sine theta, and the cosine of 180º + theta equals negative cosine theta.

To complete this we can mirror the point around the x axis into the fourth quadrant, where the angle will be 360º - theta. We can see the sine in this quadrant is equal to the negative of the sine in the first quadrant and the cosine in this quadrant is the same as the cosine in the first quadrant. We can also note that 360º - theta is the same rotating in the opposite direction, and so we can subsitute negative theta into these relationships.



>> To find the values of the sine and the cosine in the second, third and forth quadrants of the circle, we can use symmetry from the first quadrant.

So for example, we can mirror any point on the circle in the first quadrant around the y axis into the second quadrant. So our mirrored point now is at 180º minus theta, and it has the same y coordinate as our original point. So the sine of this angle, 180º minus theta, is the same as the sine of the original angle and so we can say the sine of 180º minus theta equals the sine of theta. In comparison, the x coordinate of the mirrored point is the negative of the original, so we say the cosine of 180º minus theta equals the negative cosine of theta. Now while these two relationships hold for any theta, we can use them specifically to calculate the sine and cosine of any angle in the second quadrant.

Similarly, we can mirror the original point around the x axis into the fourth quadrant. This point is at an angle of 360º minus theta, but this time it's y coordinate is negative of the original and the x coordinate is the same. Therefore we can say the sine of 360º - theta equals negative sine theta, and the cosine of 360º - theta equals the cosine of theta. We can also note here that 360º minus theta is the same as rotating our line in the opposite direction, and so we can rewrite the angle as just negative theta.

Finally we can mirror the original point around the y axis and x axis into the third quadrant. This point is at an angle of 180º + theta, and both it's y and x coordinates are the negative of the original so we can say the sine of 180º + theta equals negative sine theta, and the cosine of 180º + theta equals negative cosine theta.

And so we've shown how we can find the sine or cosine of any angle from the sine or cosine of an angle in the first quadrant. We can of course do the same exercise with the other trigonometric functions.

Now, let's use this geometry to quickly examine the bounds of the trigonometric functions. Looking at the sine and cosine, we can see that these functions only have values between -1 and 1.

Next looking at the Tan and Cot, we can see these functions can have any value between negative infinity to positive infinity

And finally looking at the Sec and Cosec, we can see their values can be between negative infinity and positive infinity but not between -1 and 1.

Ok, so we have covered where the trigonometric functions come from and why they apply to all right angle triangles, and we've seen two geometries that have helped us name the functions, see some relationships between them, and helped us bound their values. So we are going to stop here, but remember, many of the diagrams in the video were interactive, so if you forgot to do so during the video, go back and play with them now, and doing so may help you get a more intuitive understanding of the various things discussed. This interactive video was created with FigureOne, an open source project on GitHub.

Now, these are just two geometries showing how the 

 negative x coordinate, and it touches the circle at the same y coordinate, so we can say the sine of both angles is the same. Thus the sine of theta equals the sine of 180º minus theta. We can use this to calculate the sine of any angle in the second quadrant.
So for example, we can mirror the sine of theta around the y axis into the second quadrant. The mirrored sine line's y coordinate is the same as the original, and the angle of the mirrored radius is 180º - theta, so we can say the sine of theta equals the sine of 180º - theta. And we can use this to calculate the sine of any angle in the second quadrant. Similarly we can mirror the sine of theta around the x axis into the fourth quadrant. The mirrored radius angle is 360º minus theta, but this time the mirrored sine line is the same length, but negative, so we can say the sine of 360º minus theta is equal to negative sine theta. And we can use this to calculate all the angles in the forth quadrant. Here we can also note that 360º - theta is the same as -theta, and so we can also write this relationship as the sine of negative theta equals negative sine theta.

Finally, let's mirror the sine of theta around the y axis and x axis to the third quadrant. Our new angle is 180º plus theta, and as the sine line is again negative we can say the sine of 180º plus theta equals negative sine theta.

And so with these equations we can calculate the sine at every angle from 90º to 360º from the sines in the first quadrant. Note that as the angle goes above 360º, the sine values start to repeat, so the sine of angles great

and see there is a value for sine and see the sine of 180º - theta in the second quadrant will have the same value. the sine of theta in the first quadrant, will have the same value as the sine of 180º - theta in the second quadrant. Similarly, the first quadrant sine of theta will be the negative of the third quadrant sine of 180º plus theta. And finally the sine of theta in the first quadrant will be the negative of the sine of 360º - theta in the fourth quadrant, which we can also right as the sine of negative theta.

As the angle grows beyond 360º, the sine values begin to repeat.

Using the same process, we can similarly see the cosine of theta in the first quadrant is the negative of the cosine of 180 - theta in the second quadrant, the negative of the cosine of 180 + theta in third quadrant, and equal to the sine of 360 - theta, or just the cosine of minus theta in the fourth quadrant.

We can now plug the sine and cosine relationships into the remaining trigonmetric functions to find their values in the second, third and fourth quadrants as well.















This geometry both shows the relationships between the trionometric functions, as well as gives meaning to the names they have.

At it's heart, it is three similar right angle triangles. Any triangles with the same set of angles are similar, and so right angle triangles with an angle theta must all be similar as we have defined two angles - theta and the right angle.


>> Triangles have three angles that add to 180º, so only two angles are needed to define all three.

Welcome to this interactive video, introducing the where trigonometric functions come from. This video is interactive, so if you see me interacting with an element on the screen, such as this sec line here, then you can to. When you do, the video will pause, so press play when you're ready to continue.

To understand the trigonometric functions we apply the study of similar triangles to right angle triangles, and so we start by reviewing two properties of similar triangles.
* The first is any triangles that have the same set of angles, are similar triangles.
* The second is similar triangles have equal corresponding side ratios, for any two corresponding sides.
* So, let's apply this to right angle trianlges. A right angle triangle has a right angle, and so when we define an angle theta, we effectively define all three angles as their sum is always 180º.
* So All right angle triangles with the same angle theta have the same set of angles and will be similar
* Meaning all right angle triangles with angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios
* Ok, so let's develop this, by naming the sides relative to theta and measuring the different side ratios. This diagram is interactive and we can move the top corner of the triangle, to look at the different ratios for different triangles. Now if we're careful, and try and keep theta constant we can see that the ratios stay constant, as we just showed they should with similar triangles. If on the other hand we change the angle by moving the hypotenuse, we can see the ratios change, and so we can say the ratios are dependant on, or a function of theta.
> These ratios are constant when theta is constant, but change when with theta, and so are a dependant on, or a function of theta.
* These functions are the trigonometric functions, and they each have a commonly used special name. Now these names are not immediately intuitive, but we can use the geometry from the start of the video to both see where the names come from, and explore some relationships between the functions.

* So starting with their names, we first need to know that a line that touches the circle at one point, and is perpendicular to the radius line at the same point, is called a tangent line, where the word tangent comes from the latin word meaning to touch.
* And so we call the line opposite theta that's touching the circle at a right angle to the radius, the tangent, or just tan for short. Now, as we change theta, the tangent line changes, and so it is a function of theta, however here we will leave off the theta to keep the diagram as simple as possible.
* Secondly, a line that cuts through the circle is called a secant line, where the word secant comes from the latin word meaning to cut.
* And so we call the line adjacent to theta, that cuts through the circle the secant, or just sec for short, remembering the sec is also a function of theta.
* Thirdly the line between any two points on a circle is a chord line where the word chord comes from the Latin word meaning bowstring. This means the line opposite theta inside the circle is a half chord, and while originally in Sanskrit it was called just that, a half chord or half bowstring, our word sine (which we often abreviate without the e) comes from a more recent Latin translation that lost this meaning.
> While this lines name has its roots from Sanskrit meaning half-cord or half bowstring, the more recent translation into Latin lost this meaning. Nevertheless, we can think of the sine as the half cord as that's what it is.
> This line is a half cord, and our word sine derived from Latin has its roots in Sanskrit and Ancient Greek as a half cord or half bowstring.
* The remaining lines in our geometry are then these first three lines related to the complementary angle of theta.
* So the top horizontal line is the tangent of the complementary angle, and we call it the complimentary tangent of theta, cotangent, cotan or just the cot.
* We also have a secant of the complementary angle, and so we call it the cosecant, cosec or csc.
* And our final line is the sine of the complementary angle, and so we call it the cosine or cos.
* So now, how do we decide which names go with which ratios? Well we start by recognizing this geometry is actually three similar triangles, each with a side of length 1 in a different position relative to theta.
* We can then take our first triangle and fill in all the side ratios. Firstly the side opposite theta over the hypotenuse will be the sine function over 1, or just the sine function.
* Similarly, the adjacent over the hyptoneuse is the cosine function, and we can fill in the remainder of the ratios.
* Now, as all the triangles are similar, then the corresponding side ratios are the same, so we can equate the ratios of all three triangles. So let's first equate the ratios from the second triangle, and finally the third triangle.
* Now, each ratio here has an expression that is one of our named sides, and so that is the name we give the ratio, and as such, the trigonmetric functions are defined and named.
* Looking at this we have a bunch of relationships here, but we don't have to worry about remembering them all as with just one relationship for each function, we can derive the others. So lets keep just one key relationship for each function.
> And now let's simplify this down to just one relationship per function.
> And we are left with a number of relationships between the trigonometric functions - but you don't need to remember them all. In fact, you just remember a small portion, you can derive the rest relatively easily. Firstly, we can identify
> Each ratio has an expression that it is equal to one of our named sides, and these are the names of the trigonometric functions.
> We also have two columns of relationships between functions, which for now we will pair down to just those that are most convenient to remember, as all others can be derived from them.
Now in addition to showing us where the names of our trigonemtric functions come from, this geometry can also be used to show other common relationships between the functions that we haven't seen yet, as well as give us some idea about how the functions are bounded.

To do so, we can change this geometry by moving the sec or cosec lines, and touching any of the expressions on the left here to turn on and off the lines.

So for example, if we focus on just the sine and cosine functions, we can see they are two sides of a right angle triangle and so we can use pythagorus to relate them. Also, as the hyptoentuse is 1, and must always be longer than the other sides we can say the sine and cosine lengths can never be larger than 1.

Now what about the Tan and Sec? Well let's see by turning off the sine and cosine and turning on the tan and sec. They also form a right angle triangle, but this time the Sec is the hypotenuse so their relationship is slightly different. Also, because the sec is the hypotenuse, we can see that its length must always be longer than the tan.

Another common relatipnship we can see with this geometry is between the sine and the tan. As our angle get's smaller, the sine, the tan and the arc between them all approach the same length. This leads to a well known, very useful limit used extensively in calculus.

Now, let's find an angle where two functions have the same length. Maybe most easy to see is the sec and cosec are equal at 45º. This makes sense remembering the cosec is the sec of the complementary angle, and we can expect similar for the other complimentary pairs - the sine and cosine and tan and cot.


Ok, we can now extend this geometry out to a full circle, and then flip and rotate some of the similar triangles to see a different form of the geometry. Now, this geometry separates the sec and the cosec lines, making them easier to see, it shows how the tan and cot lines combine to form a tangent line that subtends, or covers the entire quadrant.

And it can also help us extend the trigonometric functions for theta values beyond 0 to 90º. To do this, lets look at just the sine and the cosine, and as we rotate the unit radius within the first quadrant, we can see the x and y coordinates of points on the circle equal the cosine and sine functions. But our cosine and sine definitions come from side ratios of a right angle triangle, and so are limited to theta values between 0 and 90º. Therefore if instead we say the cosine and sine functions are defined by the x and y coordinates of points on a unit circle, this is still consistent with right angle triangles in the first quadrant, but allows us to use these functions for angles outside of 0º to 90º.

>Now our sine and consine functions have been defined as the ratios of sides of a right angle triangle, but if instead we say the sine and cosine functions are the x and y coordinates of a circle, it is still consistent with the right angle triangle definition, but extends the 

>Now if we change our definitions around and say the cosine and sine functions come from x and y coordinates of points on the circle instead of just the ratios of a triangles sides, then we can define sine and cosine for theta values greater than 90º.

Let's start by finding the sine and cosine values for angles within the second quardant by mirroring any point on the circle in the first quadrant around the y axis. The mirrored point is at an angle of 180º minus theta, and it has the same y coordinate but negative x coordinate of the original point.

And so we can say the sine of 180º minus theta is equal to the sine of theta, and the cosine of 180º minus theta is the negative of cosine theta. These two relationships will hold for any theta, but we can use them to calculate the sine and cosine of any angle in the second quadrant.

We can do a similar exercise for the third quadrant, but this time mirror the point around the y and x axes. The new points is at 180º + theta, and the sine and cosine functions are both the negatives of the first quadrant, and so we can say the sine of 180º + theta equals negative sine theta, and the cosine of 180º + theta equals negative cosine theta.

To complete this we can mirror the point around the x axis into the fourth quadrant, where the angle will be 360º - theta. We can see the sine in this quadrant is equal to the negative of the sine in the first quadrant and the cosine in this quadrant is the same as the cosine in the first quadrant. We can also note that 360º - theta is the same rotating in the opposite direction, and so we can subsitute negative theta into these relationships.



>> To find the values of the sine and the cosine in the second, third and forth quadrants of the circle, we can use symmetry from the first quadrant.

So for example, we can mirror any point on the circle in the first quadrant around the y axis into the second quadrant. So our mirrored point now is at 180º minus theta, and it has the same y coordinate as our original point. So the sine of this angle, 180º minus theta, is the same as the sine of the original angle and so we can say the sine of 180º minus theta equals the sine of theta. In comparison, the x coordinate of the mirrored point is the negative of the original, so we say the cosine of 180º minus theta equals the negative cosine of theta. Now while these two relationships hold for any theta, we can use them specifically to calculate the sine and cosine of any angle in the second quadrant.

Similarly, we can mirror the original point around the x axis into the fourth quadrant. This point is at an angle of 360º minus theta, but this time it's y coordinate is negative of the original and the x coordinate is the same. Therefore we can say the sine of 360º - theta equals negative sine theta, and the cosine of 360º - theta equals the cosine of theta. We can also note here that 360º minus theta is the same as rotating our line in the opposite direction, and so we can rewrite the angle as just negative theta.

Finally we can mirror the original point around the y axis and x axis into the third quadrant. This point is at an angle of 180º + theta, and both it's y and x coordinates are the negative of the original so we can say the sine of 180º + theta equals negative sine theta, and the cosine of 180º + theta equals negative cosine theta.

And so we've shown how we can find the sine or cosine of any angle from the sine or cosine of an angle in the first quadrant. We can of course do the same exercise with the other trigonometric functions.

Now, let's use this geometry to quickly examine the bounds of the trigonometric functions. Looking at the sine and cosine, we can see that these functions only have values between -1 and 1.

Next looking at the Tan and Cot, we can see these functions can have any value between negative infinity to positive infinity

And finally looking at the Sec and Cosec, we can see their values can be between negative infinity and positive infinity but not between -1 and 1.

Ok, so we have covered where the trigonometric functions come from and why they apply to all right angle triangles, and we've seen two geometries that have helped us name the functions, see some relationships between them, and helped us bound their values. So we are going to stop here, but remember, many of the diagrams in the video were interactive, so if you forgot to do so during the video, go back and play with them now, and doing so may help you get a more intuitive understanding of the various things discussed. This interactive video was created with FigureOne, an open source project on GitHub. If you liked it, then give the project a star, and if you want you can read the documentation, tutorials and examples and create something yourself. Thanks for watching!




Now, these are just two geometries showing how the 

 negative x coordinate, and it touches the circle at the same y coordinate, so we can say the sine of both angles is the same. Thus the sine of theta equals the sine of 180º minus theta. We can use this to calculate the sine of any angle in the second quadrant.
So for example, we can mirror the sine of theta around the y axis into the second quadrant. The mirrored sine line's y coordinate is the same as the original, and the angle of the mirrored radius is 180º - theta, so we can say the sine of theta equals the sine of 180º - theta. And we can use this to calculate the sine of any angle in the second quadrant. Similarly we can mirror the sine of theta around the x axis into the fourth quadrant. The mirrored radius angle is 360º minus theta, but this time the mirrored sine line is the same length, but negative, so we can say the sine of 360º minus theta is equal to negative sine theta. And we can use this to calculate all the angles in the forth quadrant. Here we can also note that 360º - theta is the same as -theta, and so we can also write this relationship as the sine of negative theta equals negative sine theta.

Finally, let's mirror the sine of theta around the y axis and x axis to the third quadrant. Our new angle is 180º plus theta, and as the sine line is again negative we can say the sine of 180º plus theta equals negative sine theta.

And so with these equations we can calculate the sine at every angle from 90º to 360º from the sines in the first quadrant. Note that as the angle goes above 360º, the sine values start to repeat, so the sine of angles great

and see there is a value for sine and see the sine of 180º - theta in the second quadrant will have the same value. the sine of theta in the first quadrant, will have the same value as the sine of 180º - theta in the second quadrant. Similarly, the first quadrant sine of theta will be the negative of the third quadrant sine of 180º plus theta. And finally the sine of theta in the first quadrant will be the negative of the sine of 360º - theta in the fourth quadrant, which we can also right as the sine of negative theta.

As the angle grows beyond 360º, the sine values begin to repeat.

Using the same process, we can similarly see the cosine of theta in the first quadrant is the negative of the cosine of 180 - theta in the second quadrant, the negative of the cosine of 180 + theta in third quadrant, and equal to the sine of 360 - theta, or just the cosine of minus theta in the fourth quadrant.

We can now plug the sine and cosine relationships into the remaining trigonmetric functions to find their values in the second, third and fourth quadrants as well.


Now let's talk about the bounds of the functions.

 And so we can see the sine of angles in the second quadrant is the same as the angles in the first quadrant



As this geometry is interactive, I suggest you yourslef
We will 
And so we have our trigonometric functions now, we can use our interactive geometry to play around and get a feel for what these functions are, find other ways that they're related and get an idea of their bounds.
* To play around, you can change the angle theta, by draggin the sec or cosec lines, and you can touch the various relationships to the left to turn on and off lines.

> Now, its time to explore the interactive geometry, and find some other interesting relationships and properties of the trigonometric functions, as well as get an intuitive feel for them. So we can change the geometry by changing the angle theta, and we can turn on and off lines by touching the relevant rows in the equations here.
> These are not the only relationships or properties, and they can also be found from studying the math, but sometimes a picture can highlight relationships that might not be as obvious in the Math.
* Let's start by comparing the sine and the tan, and we can see as the angle gets smaller, the sine, the tan and the arc length betwen them all approach the same length. In fact, this is a well known limit and is used throughout calculus.
* Next comparing the Sec and Cosec, we can see that at 45ª their lengths are the same, which is expected as they are compliments of each other, and so, we can expect the same for the other complimentary pairs, the sine and cosine, and tan and cot.
* Now let's look at the sine and cosine, and they form a right angle triangle with the unit radius. So we can use the pythagorean theorem to relate them, and we can also see as 1 is the hypotenuse, then the length of the sine and cosine must always be less than 1.
* We can similarly show this with the tan and sec. but here the sec is the hypotenuse, and therefore it's length must always be greater than the tan, and always greater than 1.
* Now, let's extend this geometry out to a full circle and see the trigonometric functions for theta values between 90º and 360º. For instance we can see in the second and third quadrant, the cosine is negative, and the 3rd and 4th quadrants the sine is negative.
* Let's now change up this geometry to look at the bounds of our functions, and we will do so by flipping and rotating our similar triangles.
* The first thing we see is the sine and cosine are the x, y coordinates of each point on the circle, and so are limited between -1 and 1.
* In contrast, the sec and cosec can range between -inf and inf, but never have values between -1 and 1
* Finally, the tan and cot range from -inf to inf but can be all values in between
* Now these are just some examples of relationships and properties you can get from these geometries, so I encourage you to play with them, and use them to highlight other relationships between the trigonometric functions, remembering you can find most of these relationships from the math directly, but it can sometimes be quicker, or more impactful to see them visually as well.









* Finally, here is another geometry that shows the same relationships between the trigonometric functions, but in a different way. It has the same three similar triangles, but flipped and rotated into different positions to show the full tangent line on a circle, and is useful for visualizing the sign of the sec and cosec functions, as well as seeing how the tangent and cotengent line lenghts are related.


* We can now fill in our ratios drawing from the names in each triangle.
* Now, we can also fill in a bunch more ratios and see any number of differen relationships, but really there are some that you will come across more frequently.


* As each triangle is similar, their side ratios are the same, but each triangle can be used to name two ratios by 
This means, each pair of ratios with the same denominator can be expressed with the side lengths from the triangle with the side of length 1 that is the 





* So, if you have a right angle triangle with angle theta, then you have defined angle theta, the right angle, and by extension the complementary angle, meaning all right angle triangles with angle theta will have the same set of angles and be similar.



Similar triangles have the property that the corresponding side ratios are the same. So these three triangles all have similar


Right angle trinagle intro

# Introduction
Welcome to this interactive video describing why the trigonmetric functions exist, and where they come from. This video is interactive, which means if you see me interacting with an element on the screen, for example this unit radius, then you can too. When you do, the video will pause, so just press play when you are ready to continue. 

Now this title geometry is what we'll be building up to in this video as it visually shows the relationship between all the trigonometric functions, as well as gives meaning to their names and where they come from. As the geometry is interactive, hopefully if you play around with it, you might get some insights into the relationships between the functions that might not have been as obvious when just looking at the math.

So to build this up, we first need to review the properties of similar triangles, as they are at the heart of the trigonometric functions.


# Similar Triangles
So, similar triangles have equal corresponding angles, or the same set of angles, they have corresponding sides that are all equally scaled and they have equal corresponding side ratios.

So for example, if you take the ratio of sides sA and sB from the bottom triangle, the factor s cancels and we are left with the ratio of corresponding sides A and B from the top triangle, and you can do this for any set of sides.

Now, all of these properties are a consequence of each other - meaning that triangles with any of these properties, will in fact have all of these properties and be similar.


>> Why is this so important? Well we will see the trigonometric functions are just side ratios, so when we develop the functions on one size of triangle, we can use this to show they actually apply to all sizes of triangles.

# Right Angle Triangles
With this in hand, let's talk about right angle triangles where one angle is a right angle. Now if we define one more angle theta, then because angles in a triangle always add to 180º, we are effectively defining all three angles.

So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta have the same set of angles.

This is a property of similar triangles, which means all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will be similar.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side


# Ratios
So for instance, the ratio between the side opposite theta and the hypotenuse will be have the same value,  or be constant, for any right angle triangle, no matter its size, as long as it has an angle theta.

It also means the ratio between the side adjacent to theta and the hypotenuse is constant for all right triangles with theta.

And we can say the same for all the different possible side ratios.

Now, these ratios are constant when theta is constant, but when we change theta, which we can do here by dragging the hypotenuse, we can see the ratio values change. This means each ratio is dependent on, or a function of theta. 

And these are the trigonometric functions.

# Names
## Lines
Each of these functions have abreviated names that come directly from Latin, and are not immediately intuitive. However, the names are all derived from just three different lines related to a circle, and knowing these lines can help make some sense of the names.

The first line is the one between any two points on a circle and is called a chord. The word chord comes from the latin word meaning bowstring, and you might see the bow when you highlight the arc between the cord.

The second line touches the circle in just one spot and is called a tangent line coming from the latin word meaning to touch. The tangent line has the property that it is at right angles to the radius line that touches the same point on the circle.

The third line cuts through the circle and is called a secant line coming from the latin word meaning to cut.

So, how do these three lines relate to our triangle ratios?

## Unit Circle
>Well, it's time to build up our geometry we saw at the start of this video, and our ultimate goal is to find several similar triangles, where each triangle has side that is length 1, but that side is different in each triangle, so in the first triangle it make be opposite theta, the second adjacent to theta and the third the hypotenuse. Now, as these triangles are similar, then their side ratios will all be the same, and 
*Start sentence with tangent*
>We start with a quarter circle or radius 1, also called a unit circle, because as you will see, if we can get that value of 1 into the denominator of these equations, it will simplify them. 
>However, our conclusions below generalize to circles of any radius, as the resulting triangles will be similar, as noted above.
*Introdcue reason for geometry*
We start with a quarter circle of radius 1, or a quarter unit circle, around which we construct a right angle triangle such that the hypotenuse is tangent to the circle and touching it at some angle theta.

## Tan Sec
Now with this radius line, we actually have two right angle triangles and in the lower triiangle, we can call the side opposite theta the tangent, which is a function of theta as the line length changes with theta. We often abreviate the tangent as tan theta or just tan.

Next, the hypotenuse of this triangle is a line that cuts through the circle, and so is a secant line, which we will abbreviate just as sec.

Now as our third side is the radius line with value 1, and it is adjacent to theta, let's substitue our sides into the ratios that have the adjacent side in the denominator.

So, the opposite over the adjacent is tan over one, or simply the tangent function. Similarly the hypotenuse over adjacent is the sec function.

Now, the upper triangle in the diagram is also a right angle triangle, and using complementary angles we can show it also has an angle theta. Thus it is similar to our first triangle and shares all the same side ratios.

## Cot CSC
This triangle also has a tangent line, but this time it is opposite the *complementary angle of theta*, and so its value is the *tangent of the complementary angle*. Therefore we will call it the complementary tangent of theta, or cotangent or cot for short.

Similarly the we have a complimentary secant line, which we call the cosec or csc for short.

And our third side has a value 1 but this time it is opposite theta, so we can fill in the two ratios with the opposite side in the denominator.
So adjacent over opposite is equal to the cot, and the hypotenuse over opposite is the cosec.

## Sin Cos
So, as our two similar triangles have had an adjacent side, and then an opposite side of value 1, we'll now construct a similar triangle with a hypotenuse of value one, with a vertical line that is half of a chord, and in fact when these ratios were first developed it was called the half chord or half bowstring. However when the concept was translated into Latin, which is where our word today comes from, this original meaning was lost. So our word sine, comes from the latin word sinus meaning bay or bossum, but really, just as we think of the tan as the tangent, and sec as the secant, we can think of the sine as the half chord, as that's what it is.

That said, our opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the sine.

Our last ratio come from the line that is the sine of the complementary angle, and so we call it the complementary sine, cosine or just cos for short. In this case the cosine is adjancent to angle theta, and so we say the adjacent over hypotenuse ratio is the cosine.

And so, that was kind of a long winded way to say, each of these ratios have a special abreviated name that comes from Latin and the relationship between circles, triangles, and complementary angles.

## Common relationships
### Complementary angles
Now let's look at how some of these trigonometric functions are related to each other.

Firstly, from our definitions of the functions we have three complementary functions, the complementary sine, complementary tangent and complementary secant.

Now if we look at our geometry, we can see that just as the cosine is the sine of the complementary angle, so the sine is the cosine of the complementary angle. And so, sin theta is equal to cosine of 90º minus theta.

Similarly, you can show our other complementary pairs have the same relationsihps so the tangent is equal to the cot of the complementary angle, and the secant equal to the cosec of the complementary angle.

So we have three complementary pairs of trigonometrics functions.
### Reciprocal pairs
We also have three reciprocal pairs of functions.

So the opposite over the hypotenuse is reciprocal to the hyptotenuse over the opposite. This means sin and cosec are recripocals of each other. Similarly cos and sec are reciprocals of each other, and tan and cot.

### Tan Sin Cos
Another important relationship is between the tan, sine and cosine. We start by finding expressions of the opposite and adjacent sides, and then substituting those into the tangent ratio. The hypotenuses cancel, and we are left with the tangent function is the sine function over the cosine function.

And with just these relationships, we can see how if we have just the sine function, we can calculate all other functions from it. The cosine is the complementary sine, the tangent is then the sine over the cosine, and the remaining three functiosn are reciprocals of the first three.

### Geometry

Finally, let's experiment with our geometry to make some additional observations about the trigonometric functions, and the relationships between them.

Let's start with just the sec and the tan, which are two sides of a right angle triangle. Now, as the secand is the hypotenuse, then it must always have a longer length than the tangent, even as the lengths get very large as we approach 90º. Also, using pythagorus with this geometry helps us come up with an equation that relate the two functions.


If we extend this geometry to a full circle, instead of just a quarter circle, we can see the sin and cosine values trace out the circle - in other words they are the x, y coordinates of the circle. Similarly, the sec and cosec values are simply the x and y intercept points of the tangent line to the circle.

Another interesting observation we can make is the sine and cosine values are limited to the range between -1 and 1. In comparison the sec and cosec go from -inf to +inf, but without ever being between -1 and 1.

Now, this isn't the only way we can draw this geometry. We can also use symmetry to form it like this.

With this geometry we can confirm the complementary nature of the funcitons, and see that when the complementary angle equals theta, when both are 45º, then so sec equals the cosec.

We can also use pythagorus to see the relationship between sine and cosine.

Also, we can see the length of the sine and the tan become more and more similar as the angle gets smaller, and the cos and cot become more similar as the angle approaches 90º.

Anyway, I encourage you to play with the geometries here to get a feeling for how the trigonometric functions are related. Doing so will also make it 





And one observation we can make is the secant line must always be longer than the tangent line, as the secant line is the hypotenuse of the triangle it makes with the tan. So even as they get larger and larger, as the angle approaches 90º, the secant is larger than the tangent.

Also, as

Firstly, the sec and the tan are two sides of a right angle triangle. This means we can use pythagorus to find the relationship directly between the two functions. It also means, that as the secant is the hypotenuse, then it will always have a longer length than the tangent.

Now, using alegbra and the geometry on the right you can express any of these ratios in terms of any other ratio. Therefore, if you know any of the ratios, you can calulate the rest from that ratio. But in this video, we will just look at some of these relationships, which if you remember will set you in good stead to derive the rest.

Firstly, three of these functions are complimentary functions



And while this is an interesting exercise, for now we will just focus the most common arrangements, which will be most useful to remember.

We start by rearranging the first two ratios to get expressions for the opposite and adjacent sides, and then substituting these into the third ratio. They hypotenuses cancel, and we see that the tan function is equal to the sin divided by the cosine.

The fourth ratio is the reciprocal of the first ratio, and so the cossec is one over the sine.

Similarly the sec is the reciprocal of the cosine, and the cot is the reciprocal of the tangent.

Finally, one more useful set of 
# Summary
So we have seen 
## Relationships
Now, there are many ways to use algebra and the geometry on the right to rearrange these ratios to be interms of any of the other ratios, but we will focus on just the few which are most common, with the understanding that you can find any of the others pretty easily.

Sor
Limits of Functions:
* Sin and cosine are a right angle trinalge where 1 is the hypotenuse, so they must always be less than 1.
* Sec and the Cosec never have magnitudes less than 1.

Relationships between functions
* Similar triangles show us 


* All complementary relationships are equal to each other with complementary angles
* sin and cosine are the coordinates of the circle
* Tan and sec are easily relatable with pythagorus
* Sec and cosec never have values between -1 and -1 - as these two ratios have hypotenuse on top and therefore are always the longest side
* Not surprisingly, at 45º, all the complementary ratios equal each other
* If you know any ratio, all others can be calculated
* The sin and tan become more similar in length near 0
* Abs(Sec) is always larger than Abs(tan)



And so these are the names we use today for each of these ratios. The names come from the relationship between right angle triangles, complementary angles and circles. This diagram not only helps us understand where the names comes from, but also helps us get an intuitive understanding of what these ratios values are, and how they are bounded.




















## Sin, Tan, Sec
Well if we take a circle with radius one, also called a unit circle, and define an arc with some angle theta, then we can draw a right angle triangle within the arc, and one outside of the arc and we can see and label some of these lines.

Firstly, we can see a line that touches the circle at one point and is perpendicular to the radius, and so is a tangent line, which we will abreviate as tan.

We can see a line that cuts through the circle, a secant line, which we will call sec.

And we can see part of a chord line. Now, using geometry you can show this is actually half of a chord, and it was called a half chord or half bowstring when these concepts were first developed in Sanskrit by Indian Mathematitians. Now our word today sine, comes from the Latin translation of this which unfortunately lost the original meaning. Maybe it would make more sense to be called a half-chord, but nevertheless, sine is the word we use and we usually abreviate this without the e.

Now, let's substitude these names into ratios where the unit circle simplifies the result.

Firstly, our inside right angle triangle has an opposite side over hypotenuse ratio equal to sin over 1, as the hypotenuse is the radius of length 1. This simplifies down to just the sine, and consequently this ratio is called the sine function.

Next, our outside right angle triangle has an opposite side over adjacent side ratio equal to tan over 1, as here the adjacent side is the radius of length 1, which in turn simplifies down to just the tan, and so this ratio is called the tan function.

Thirdly, the outside right angle trianlge has a hypotenuse over adjacent side ratio equal to sec over 1, resulting in this ratio being called the sec function.

## Cos, Cot, Csc
Now, we are going to construct inside and outside right angle triangles around the complementary angle of theta.

These triangles 

The names of our three remaining ratios come from the similar triangles created from the complementary angle of theta.

So, we start with our complementary angle, and construct our inside and outside triangles.

This means we have a tangent of the complmentary angle

Now if we look at our remaining ratios, we can see each one is just a reciprocal of one we've already named, nevertheless they all have individual names, and all these names come from the concept of a complementary angle





# RESET from Sin, Tan, Sec
Well we start by taking a circle with radius one, also called a unit circle, and define an arc with some angle theta, around which we can draw a right angle triangle.

## Tan, sec

Now, the side opposite theta of this right angle triangle is a tangent line, so we will call it tan. The hypotenuse cuts through the circle, so its a secant line, that we will call sec, and our adjacent side is the radius, which is 1.

Let's now rewrite all of our ratios in terms of these sides. So the opposite side over the hypotenuse is tan over sec. The adjacent side over hypotenuse is 1 over sec. The opposite side over the adjacent side is then tan over 1, which just simplifies down to tan, and we can continue to fill out our ratios.

## Sin, Cosine
Ok great.

Now we draw a right angle triangle within the arc. This triangle also has an angle theta and is thus similar to our first triangle and all its side ratios will be the same.

The side opposite theta is a part of a chord line, and in fact using geometry you can show this is actually half of a chord, and as such it was called a half chord or half bowstring when these concepts were first developed in Sanskrit by Indian Mathematitians. Now our word for this line today sine, comes from the Latin translation of the concept which unfortunately lost the original meaning. Nevertheless, sine comes from the word for half-chord and is the word we use today, though ofen we abreviate it without the e.

Next, we can recognize that the adjacent side to theta, is actually the side opposite theta's complementary angle. We can therefore say this is the sine of the complementary angle, which we then call complimentary sine of theta, which we abbreviate to cosine or cos.

Finally the hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius 1, so we can now write all our ratios in terms of these sides.

So opposite over hypotenuse is sine over 1 which simplifies down to sin. Adjacent over hypotenuse is then cos over one or just cos. And we can go ahead and fill out the remainder of the ratios.

## Cot, Cosec

Now finally we construct a third right angle triangle, but this time around the arc of the circle that covers theta's complementary angle.

Once again we have a tangent line, but in this case it's the tangent of the complimentary angle, which we cal the complimenetary tangent, cotangent, or cot for short.

We also have a secant line of the the complementary angle which we will call the complimentary secant, cosec or csc for short. And our third line is the radius 1.

Now, this right angle triangle is also similar to our first two right angle triangles because it also has the theta as well.

So let's do the same exercise and substitute our sides into the ratios, being careful to use the sides relative to theta and not the complementary angle.

## Summary
Now we have a whole bunch of different expressions for the 6 different side ratios of a right angle triangle. In fact, we could make a lot more expressions using substitution and the pythagorean theorem. But most commonly, we usually remember just a few of these, and understand we can derive the rest from them. So let's remove some of the less common ratios, and we are left with

The sine is the opposite over the hypotenuse, the cosine is the adjacent over the hypotenuse, the tangent is the opposite over the adjacent, and is often useful to remember it can be a function of the sine and cosine. The cosec, sec and cot are then the reciprocals of the sin, cosine and tangent.






# RESET
So how do these lines relate to the ratios in a triangle?

We start with a quarter circle of radius 1, around which we construct a right angle triangle such that the hypotenuse is tangent to the circle, and touches the circle at some angle theta.

Now, we have two right angle triangles, and using complementary angles, we can show that the top angle is also angle theta, meaning both right angle triangles are similar and have the same corresponding side ratios.

Also, because the triangles have a side length equal to one, some of those ratios will have a 1 in their denominator, simplifying them down to a single side.

So now, let's name our sides relative to theta.

Firstly, we will call side that covers or subtends theta in the first triangle the tangent, or just tan. The third line of this triangle is a secant line that cuts through the circle, so we call it the sec.

Let's now fill in our opposite over ajcent ratio. The side opposite theta is the tan line, whose length is a function of theta, and the adjacent side is 1.

Similarly, we can see our hypotenuse over adjacent is the sec line over one, where the sec length is also a function of theta, leaving us with just the sec.

And in fact, these two ratios are most often called the tan function and sec function.

Let's now look at our second triangle.

This triangle also has a tangent line, but this time it covers the complementary angle. Therefore we will call it the complementary tangent, cotangent or cot for short.

Similarly the we have a complimentary secant line, which we call the cosec or csc for short.

We can now fill in two more ratios, being careful to fill them in relative to theta and not the complementary angle, so the side adjacent to theta over the opposite side is equal to the cot, whose lenght is a function of theta over 1, or simply the cot, and the hypotenuse over the opposite is the cosec.

Now our final two ratios have the hypotenuse as the denominator so we need to construct a similar right angle triangle with the radius as the hypotenuse. Now this line is a half cord line, and in fact when these ratios were developed it was called the half chord or half bowstring. However, as the concept was translated into Latin, the original meaning was lost, and the Latin word sinus meaning bay or bossom was used to describe this line. As a result our word today is the sine, or sin comes from this. But we can think of it as a half cord as that is what it is.

So now our opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the sine, whose length is a function of theta, over one or just the sine.

Finally, we will draw the sine of the complementary angle, which we will call the cosine or cos for short. And with it, we see our last ratio is simply the cos.

And so these are the names we use today for each of these ratios. The names come from the relationship between right angle triangles, complementary angles and circles. This diagram not only helps us understand where the names comes from, but also helps us get an intuitive understanding of what these ratios values are, and how they are bounded.







So let's name our sides relative to the angle theta. First we will name the tangent line that subtends the angle theta, tan (from tangent). And the

Now our second triangle also has a tangent line, but it covers the complementary angle, so we will call it the complementary tan, or cotan or cot for short. And our final line is the complementary secant line, or which we call the cosec or csc.

# Where we are going
This video is going to build up to this geometry which shows the relationship between the trigonometric functions. You can move the radius and see how the length of the lines which corresponds with teh value of the functions change, and hopefully draw out some insights that are in there in the mathematics, but maybe not quite as tangible as when you see and play with a diagram that shows them.

In this video, we will build up this diagram that relates the trigonometric functions. Along the way we will see why the trigonometric functions exist, where their names come from and then use this diagram to get insights into the relationships between the functions. YOu can get the same insights from looking at the math of the relationships, but for some, like myself, different insights pop out in different ways. Interacting with this diagram make it obvious to me that the sec and cosec cannot exist between -1 and 1. For instance, using this diagram you can see that the cosine and sine are limited to within + and minus 1. In contrast the sec and cosec can be any value between -inf and +inf except between + and minus 1. Such insights are clear from the math, but studying the 

# Similar Triangles
*Really drive home the last point*
We first need to review properties of similar triangles.

Two triangles are similar when they have the same set of angles, and have corresponding side lengths that are scaled by the same factor. This then helps us understand a third property, which is the ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles will be equal. So if we take the ratio of sides sA and sB from the bottom triangle, the s term cancels and we are left with the same ratio as sides A and B from the top triangle. These properties are a consequence of each other, and so triangles with any of these properties will have all of these properties and be similar.

# Right Angle Triangles
The trigonometric functions come from studying the relationship between sides and angles in a right angle triangle.

So what does this mean for right angle triangles?

Well, by definition as we know one angle is a right angle, when we define one more angle theta, then because angles in a triangle always add to 180º, we are effectively defining all three angles.

So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta have the same set of angles.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will be similar.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios.
