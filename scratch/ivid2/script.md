# Introduction
Welcome to this interactive video describing where the trigonometric functions come from. This video is interactive, which means if you see me interacting with an element on the screen, then you can too. When you do, the video will pause, so just press play when you are ready to continue.

# Similar Triangles
To understand where the trigonometric functions come from, we first need to remember properties of similar triangles.

Two triangles are said to be similar when they have the same shape, but are of different size. This means, their corresponding angles are all equal, so they have the same shape, and their corresponding sides are all scaled by the same amount. This then helps us understand a third property, which is the ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles will be equal. So if we take the ratio of sides sA and sB, the s term cancels and we are left with the same ratio as sides A and B from the top triangle. Finally, if you can show triangles have any of these properties, then in fact those triangles will be similar, and will have all of the properties.

# Right Angle Triangles
So what does this mean for right angle triangles?

Well, by definition as we know one angle is a right angle, when we define one more angle theta, then because angles in a triangle always add to 180ยบ, we are effectively defining all three angles.

So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta have the same set of angles.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will be similar.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios.

# Ratios
So that means for instance that the ratio between the side opposite theta and the hypotenuse is the same value for all right triangles with the same angle theta.

It also means the ratio between the side adjacent to theta and the hypotenuse is the same for all right triangles with theta.

And similarly we can say the same for all the different possible side ratios.

Now, the ratio values all change with angle and as we change theta between 0 and 90 degrees, we can see how the ratio values change. This means each ratio is dependent on, or a function of theta. 

# Names
## Lines
Each of these functions have abreviated names that come directly from Latin, so the names are not necessarily intuitive. However, the names are all derived from just three different lines related to a circle, and knowing these lines can help make some sense of the names.

The first line is between two points on a circle and is called a chord. The word chord comes from the latin word meaning bowstring, and you might see the bow when you highlight the arc between the cord.

The second line touches the circle in just one spot and is called a tangent line coming from the latin word meaning to touch. The tangent line has the property that it is at right angles to the radius line that touches the same point on the circle.

The third line cuts through the circle and is called a secant line coming from the latin word meaning to cut.

So, how do these three lines relate to our triangle ratios?

## Unit Circle

We start with a quarter circle of radius 1, around which we construct a right angle triangle such that the hypotenuse is tangent to the circle, and touches the circle at some angle theta.

Now, we have two right angle triangles, and using complementary angles, we can show that the top angle is also angle theta, meaning both right angle triangles are similar and have the same corresponding side ratios.

Also, because the triangles have a side length equal to one, some of those ratios will have a 1 in their denominator, simplifying them down to a single side.

So now, let's name our sides relative to theta.

## Tan Sec
Firstly, we will call side that covers or subtends theta in the first triangle the tangent, or just tan. The third line of this triangle is a secant line that cuts through the circle, so we call it the sec.

Let's now fill in our opposite over ajcent ratio. The side opposite theta is the tan line, whose length is a function of theta, and the adjacent side is 1, and this simplifies to just the tan.

Similarly, we can see our hypotenuse over adjacent is the sec line over one, leaving us with just the sec.

Let's now look at our second triangle.

## Cot CSC
This triangle also has a tangent line, but this time it covers the complementary angle. Therefore we will call it the complementary tangent, cotangent or cot for short.

Similarly the we have a complimentary secant line, which we call the cosec or csc for short.

We can now fill in two more ratios, being careful to fill them in relative to theta and not the complementary angle, so the side adjacent to theta over the opposite side is equal to the cot, and the hypotenuse over the opposite is the cosec.

## Sin Cos
Now our final two ratios have the hypotenuse as the denominator so we construct a similar right angle triangle with a hypotenuse of 1. Now this line is a half cord line, and in fact when these ratios were developed it was called the half chord or half bowstring. However, as the concept was translated into Latin, the original meaning was lost, and the Latin word sinus meaning bay or bossom was used to describe this line. As a result our word today is the sine, or sin comes from this.

So now our opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the sine, whose length is a function of theta, over one or just the sine.

Our third side of this triangle is actually the sine of the complementary angle, and so we call it the complementary sine, cosine or cos for short. And with it, we see our last ratio is simply the cos.


And so, that was kind of a long winded way to say, each of these ratios have a special name, and these names come from the relationship between circles, triangles and right angles.

## Relationships
Now, you also see these functions expressed as relationships relative to each other, and in fact, you can express each of these functions in terms of any other function, but we are going to look at just the most common relationships and understand it's pretty easy to derive all the others.  






And so these are the names we use today for each of these ratios. The names come from the relationship between right angle triangles, complementary angles and circles. This diagram not only helps us understand where the names comes from, but also helps us get an intuitive understanding of what these ratios values are, and how they are bounded.




















## Sin, Tan, Sec
Well if we take a circle with radius one, also called a unit circle, and define an arc with some angle theta, then we can draw a right angle triangle within the arc, and one outside of the arc and we can see and label some of these lines.

Firstly, we can see a line that touches the circle at one point and is perpendicular to the radius, and so is a tangent line, which we will abreviate as tan.

We can see a line that cuts through the circle, a secant line, which we will call sec.

And we can see part of a chord line. Now, using geometry you can show this is actually half of a chord, and it was called a half chord or half bowstring when these concepts were first developed in Sanskrit by Indian Mathematitians. Now our word today sine, comes from the Latin translation of this which unfortunately lost the original meaning. Maybe it would make more sense to be called a half-chord, but nevertheless, sine is the word we use and we usually abreviate this without the e.

Now, let's substitude these names into ratios where the unit circle simplifies the result.

Firstly, our inside right angle triangle has an opposite side over hypotenuse ratio equal to sin over 1, as the hypotenuse is the radius of length 1. This simplifies down to just the sine, and consequently this ratio is called the sine function.

Next, our outside right angle triangle has an opposite side over adjacent side ratio equal to tan over 1, as here the adjacent side is the radius of length 1, which in turn simplifies down to just the tan, and so this ratio is called the tan function.

Thirdly, the outside right angle trianlge has a hypotenuse over adjacent side ratio equal to sec over 1, resulting in this ratio being called the sec function.

## Cos, Cot, Csc
Now, we are going to construct inside and outside right angle triangles around the complementary angle of theta.

These triangles 

The names of our three remaining ratios come from the similar triangles created from the complementary angle of theta.

So, we start with our complementary angle, and construct our inside and outside triangles.

This means we have a tangent of the complmentary angle

Now if we look at our remaining ratios, we can see each one is just a reciprocal of one we've already named, nevertheless they all have individual names, and all these names come from the concept of a complementary angle





# RESET from Sin, Tan, Sec
Well we start by taking a circle with radius one, also called a unit circle, and define an arc with some angle theta, around which we can draw a right angle triangle.

## Tan, sec

Now, the side opposite theta of this right angle triangle is a tangent line, so we will call it tan. The hypotenuse cuts through the circle, so its a secant line, that we will call sec, and our adjacent side is the radius, which is 1.

Let's now rewrite all of our ratios in terms of these sides. So the opposite side over the hypotenuse is tan over sec. The adjacent side over hypotenuse is 1 over sec. The opposite side over the adjacent side is then tan over 1, which just simplifies down to tan, and we can continue to fill out our ratios.

## Sin, Cosine
Ok great.

Now we draw a right angle triangle within the arc. This triangle also has an angle theta and is thus similar to our first triangle and all its side ratios will be the same.

The side opposite theta is a part of a chord line, and in fact using geometry you can show this is actually half of a chord, and as such it was called a half chord or half bowstring when these concepts were first developed in Sanskrit by Indian Mathematitians. Now our word for this line today sine, comes from the Latin translation of the concept which unfortunately lost the original meaning. Nevertheless, sine comes from the word for half-chord and is the word we use today, though ofen we abreviate it without the e.

Next, we can recognize that the adjacent side to theta, is actually the side opposite theta's complementary angle. We can therefore say this is the sine of the complementary angle, which we then call complimentary sine of theta, which we abbreviate to cosine or cos.

Finally the hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius 1, so we can now write all our ratios in terms of these sides.

So opposite over hypotenuse is sine over 1 which simplifies down to sin. Adjacent over hypotenuse is then cos over one or just cos. And we can go ahead and fill out the remainder of the ratios.

## Cot, Cosec

Now finally we construct a third right angle triangle, but this time around the arc of the circle that covers theta's complementary angle.

Once again we have a tangent line, but in this case it's the tangent of the complimentary angle, which we cal the complimenetary tangent, cotangent, or cot for short.

We also have a secant line of the the complementary angle which we will call the complimentary secant, cosec or csc for short. And our third line is the radius 1.

Now, this right angle triangle is also similar to our first two right angle triangles because it also has the theta as well.

So let's do the same exercise and substitute our sides into the ratios, being careful to use the sides relative to theta and not the complementary angle.

## Summary
Now we have a whole bunch of different expressions for the 6 different side ratios of a right angle triangle. In fact, we could make a lot more expressions using substitution and the pythagorean theorem. But most commonly, we usually remember just a few of these, and understand we can derive the rest from them. So let's remove some of the less common ratios, and we are left with

The sine is the opposite over the hypotenuse, the cosine is the adjacent over the hypotenuse, the tangent is the opposite over the adjacent, and is often useful to remember it can be a function of the sine and cosine. The cosec, sec and cot are then the reciprocals of the sin, cosine and tangent.






# RESET
So how do these lines relate to the ratios in a triangle?

We start with a quarter circle of radius 1, around which we construct a right angle triangle such that the hypotenuse is tangent to the circle, and touches the circle at some angle theta.

Now, we have two right angle triangles, and using complementary angles, we can show that the top angle is also angle theta, meaning both right angle triangles are similar and have the same corresponding side ratios.

Also, because the triangles have a side length equal to one, some of those ratios will have a 1 in their denominator, simplifying them down to a single side.

So now, let's name our sides relative to theta.

Firstly, we will call side that covers or subtends theta in the first triangle the tangent, or just tan. The third line of this triangle is a secant line that cuts through the circle, so we call it the sec.

Let's now fill in our opposite over ajcent ratio. The side opposite theta is the tan line, whose length is a function of theta, and the adjacent side is 1.

Similarly, we can see our hypotenuse over adjacent is the sec line over one, where the sec length is also a function of theta, leaving us with just the sec.

And in fact, these two ratios are most often called the tan function and sec function.

Let's now look at our second triangle.

This triangle also has a tangent line, but this time it covers the complementary angle. Therefore we will call it the complementary tangent, cotangent or cot for short.

Similarly the we have a complimentary secant line, which we call the cosec or csc for short.

We can now fill in two more ratios, being careful to fill them in relative to theta and not the complementary angle, so the side adjacent to theta over the opposite side is equal to the cot, whose lenght is a function of theta over 1, or simply the cot, and the hypotenuse over the opposite is the cosec.

Now our final two ratios have the hypotenuse as the denominator so we need to construct a similar right angle triangle with the radius as the hypotenuse. Now this line is a half cord line, and in fact when these ratios were developed it was called the half chord or half bowstring. However, as the concept was translated into Latin, the original meaning was lost, and the Latin word sinus meaning bay or bossom was used to describe this line. As a result our word today is the sine, or sin comes from this. But we can think of it as a half cord as that is what it is.

So now our opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the sine, whose length is a function of theta, over one or just the sine.

Finally, we will draw the sine of the complementary angle, which we will call the cosine or cos for short. And with it, we see our last ratio is simply the cos.

And so these are the names we use today for each of these ratios. The names come from the relationship between right angle triangles, complementary angles and circles. This diagram not only helps us understand where the names comes from, but also helps us get an intuitive understanding of what these ratios values are, and how they are bounded.







So let's name our sides relative to the angle theta. First we will name the tangent line that subtends the angle theta, tan (from tangent). And the

Now our second triangle also has a tangent line, but it covers the complementary angle, so we will call it the complementary tan, or cotan or cot for short. And our final line is the complementary secant line, or which we call the cosec or csc.
