Right angle trinagle intro

# Introduction
Welcome to this interactive video describing why the trigonmetric functions exist, and where they come from. This video is interactive, which means if you see me interacting with an element on the screen, for example this unit radius, then you can too. When you do, the video will pause, so just press play when you are ready to continue. 

Now this title geometry is what we'll be building up to in this video as it visually shows the relationship between all the trigonometric functions, as well as gives meaning to their names and where they come from. As the geometry is interactive, hopefully if you play around with it, you might get some insights into the relationships between the functions that might not have been as obvious when just looking at the math.

So to build this up, we first need to review the properties of similar triangles, as they are at the heart of the trigonometric functions.


# Similar Triangles
So, similar triangles have equal corresponding angles, or the same set of angles, they have corresponding sides that are all equally scaled and they have equal corresponding side ratios.

So for example, if you take the ratio of sides sA and sB form the bottom triangle, the factor s cancels and we are left with the ratio A over B from the top triangle, and you can do this for any set of sides.

Now, all of these properties are a consequence of each other - meaning that triangles with any of these properties, will in fact have all of these properties and be similar.


Why is this so important? Well we will see the trigonometric functions are just side ratios, so when we develop the functions on one size of triangle, we can use this to show they actually apply to all sizes of triangles.

# Right Angle Triangles
Now specifically the trigonometric functions come from studying the relationship between sides and angles in a right angle triangle which by definition has one angle as a right angle. This means when we define one more angle theta, then because angles in a triangle always add to 180ยบ, we are effectively defining all three angles.

So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta have the same set of angles.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will be similar.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side


# Ratios
So that means for instance that the ratio between the side opposite theta and the hypotenuse is constant, or will have the same value for all right triangles with the same angle theta.

It also means the ratio between the side adjacent to theta and the hypotenuse is constant for all right triangles with theta.

And similarly we can say the same for all the different possible side ratios.

Now, these ratios are constant when theta is constant, but when we change theta, we can see the ratio values change. This means each ratio is dependent on, or a function of theta. 

And these are the trigonometric functions.

# Names
## Lines
Each of these functions have abreviated names that come directly from Latin, and are not necessarily intuitive. However, the names are all derived from just three different lines related to a circle, and knowing these lines can help make some sense of the names.

The first line is the one between any two points on a circle and is called a chord. The word chord comes from the latin word meaning bowstring, and you might see the bow when you highlight the arc between the cord.

The second line touches the circle in just one spot and is called a tangent line coming from the latin word meaning to touch. The tangent line has the property that it is at right angles to the radius line that touches the same point on the circle.

The third line cuts through the circle and is called a secant line coming from the latin word meaning to cut.

So, how do these three lines relate to our triangle ratios?

## Unit Circle
*Start sentence with tangent*
We start with a circle or radius 1, also called a unit circle, because as you will see, if we can get that value of 1 into the denominator of these equations, it will simplify them. 
However, our conclusions below generalize to circles of any radius, as the resulting triangles will be similar, as noted above.
*Introdcue reason for geometry*
We start with a quarter circle of radius 1, around which we construct a right angle triangle such that the hypotenuse touches the circle at some angle theta, and is tangent to it.

## Tan Sec
And so we can call the side opposite theta in the lower triangle the tangent, which is a function that describes how the line length changes with theta, although this is often abreviated simply as tan theta or tan.

We also have a line that cuts through the circle, and is a secant line, which we will abbreviate just as sec.

These two sides form a right angle triangle with the radius, which is adjacent to theta and has a value of 1, and so side ratios with the adjcent side in the denominator can be expressed simply as one of the two sides we just named.

So, the opposite over the adjacent is tan over one, or simply tan. Similarly the hypotenuse over adjacent is the sec.

Now, the upper triangle in the diagram is also a right angle triangle, and using complementary angles we can show it also has an angle theta. Thus it is similar to our first triangle and shares all the same side ratios.

## Cot CSC
This triangle has a tangent line, but this time it is opposite the *complementary angle of theta*, and so its value is the *tangent of the complementary angle*. Therefore we will call it the complementary tangent, or cotangent or cot for short. So now we could say, ah well lets make our ratio tan (comp)

Similarly the we have a complimentary secant line, which we call the cosec or csc for short.

Out third side has a value 1 and is this time opposite theta, so we can fill in the two ratios with the opposite side in the denominator.
So adjacent over opposite is equal to the cot, and the hypotenuse over opposite is the cosec.

## Sin Cos
So, as our two similar triangles have had an adjacent side, and then an opposite side of value 1, we'll now construct a similar triangle with a hypotenuse of value one, with a vertical line that is half of a chord, and in fact when these ratios were first developed it was called the half chord or half bowstring. However when the concept was translated into Latin, which is where our word today comes from, this original meaning was lost. So our word sine, comes from the latin word sinus meaning bay or bossum, but really, just as we think of the tan as the tangent, and sec as the secant, we can think of the sine as the half chord, as that's what it is.

So the opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the sine.

Our last ratio come from the line that is the sine of the complementary angle, and so we call it the complementary sine, cosine or just cos for short. In this case the cosine is adjancent to angle theta, and so we say the adjacent over hypotenuse ratio is the cosine.

And so, that was kind of a long winded way to say, each of these ratios have a special abreviated name that comes from Latin and the relationship between circles, triangles and right angles.

## Common relationships
Now, using alegbra and the geometry on the right you can express any of these ratios in terms of any other ratio. Therefore, if you know any of the ratios, you can calulate the rest from that ratio. And while this is an interesting exercise, for now we will just focus the most common arrangements, which will be most useful to remember.

We start by rearranging the first two ratios to get expressions for the opposite and adjacent sides, and then substituting these into the third ratio. They hypotenuses cancel, and we see that the tan function is equal to the sin divided by the cosine.

The fourth ratio is the reciprocal of the first ratio, and so the cossec is one over the sine.

Similarly the sec is the reciprocal of the cosine, and the cot is the reciprocal of the tangent.

# Summary
So we have seen 
## Relationships
Now, there are many ways to use algebra and the geometry on the right to rearrange these ratios to be interms of any of the other ratios, but we will focus on just the few which are most common, with the understanding that you can find any of the others pretty easily.

* All complementary relationships are equal to each other with complementary angles
* sin and cosine are the coordinates of the circle
* Tan and sec are easily relatable with pythagorus
* Sec and cosec never have values between -1 and -1 - as these two ratios have hypotenuse on top and therefore are always the longest side
* Not surprisingly, at 45ยบ, all the complementary ratios equal each other
* If you know any ratio, all others can be calculated
* The sin and tan become more similar in length near 0
* Abs(Sec) is always larger than Abs(tan)



And so these are the names we use today for each of these ratios. The names come from the relationship between right angle triangles, complementary angles and circles. This diagram not only helps us understand where the names comes from, but also helps us get an intuitive understanding of what these ratios values are, and how they are bounded.




















## Sin, Tan, Sec
Well if we take a circle with radius one, also called a unit circle, and define an arc with some angle theta, then we can draw a right angle triangle within the arc, and one outside of the arc and we can see and label some of these lines.

Firstly, we can see a line that touches the circle at one point and is perpendicular to the radius, and so is a tangent line, which we will abreviate as tan.

We can see a line that cuts through the circle, a secant line, which we will call sec.

And we can see part of a chord line. Now, using geometry you can show this is actually half of a chord, and it was called a half chord or half bowstring when these concepts were first developed in Sanskrit by Indian Mathematitians. Now our word today sine, comes from the Latin translation of this which unfortunately lost the original meaning. Maybe it would make more sense to be called a half-chord, but nevertheless, sine is the word we use and we usually abreviate this without the e.

Now, let's substitude these names into ratios where the unit circle simplifies the result.

Firstly, our inside right angle triangle has an opposite side over hypotenuse ratio equal to sin over 1, as the hypotenuse is the radius of length 1. This simplifies down to just the sine, and consequently this ratio is called the sine function.

Next, our outside right angle triangle has an opposite side over adjacent side ratio equal to tan over 1, as here the adjacent side is the radius of length 1, which in turn simplifies down to just the tan, and so this ratio is called the tan function.

Thirdly, the outside right angle trianlge has a hypotenuse over adjacent side ratio equal to sec over 1, resulting in this ratio being called the sec function.

## Cos, Cot, Csc
Now, we are going to construct inside and outside right angle triangles around the complementary angle of theta.

These triangles 

The names of our three remaining ratios come from the similar triangles created from the complementary angle of theta.

So, we start with our complementary angle, and construct our inside and outside triangles.

This means we have a tangent of the complmentary angle

Now if we look at our remaining ratios, we can see each one is just a reciprocal of one we've already named, nevertheless they all have individual names, and all these names come from the concept of a complementary angle





# RESET from Sin, Tan, Sec
Well we start by taking a circle with radius one, also called a unit circle, and define an arc with some angle theta, around which we can draw a right angle triangle.

## Tan, sec

Now, the side opposite theta of this right angle triangle is a tangent line, so we will call it tan. The hypotenuse cuts through the circle, so its a secant line, that we will call sec, and our adjacent side is the radius, which is 1.

Let's now rewrite all of our ratios in terms of these sides. So the opposite side over the hypotenuse is tan over sec. The adjacent side over hypotenuse is 1 over sec. The opposite side over the adjacent side is then tan over 1, which just simplifies down to tan, and we can continue to fill out our ratios.

## Sin, Cosine
Ok great.

Now we draw a right angle triangle within the arc. This triangle also has an angle theta and is thus similar to our first triangle and all its side ratios will be the same.

The side opposite theta is a part of a chord line, and in fact using geometry you can show this is actually half of a chord, and as such it was called a half chord or half bowstring when these concepts were first developed in Sanskrit by Indian Mathematitians. Now our word for this line today sine, comes from the Latin translation of the concept which unfortunately lost the original meaning. Nevertheless, sine comes from the word for half-chord and is the word we use today, though ofen we abreviate it without the e.

Next, we can recognize that the adjacent side to theta, is actually the side opposite theta's complementary angle. We can therefore say this is the sine of the complementary angle, which we then call complimentary sine of theta, which we abbreviate to cosine or cos.

Finally the hypotenuse of this triangle is the radius 1, so we can now write all our ratios in terms of these sides.

So opposite over hypotenuse is sine over 1 which simplifies down to sin. Adjacent over hypotenuse is then cos over one or just cos. And we can go ahead and fill out the remainder of the ratios.

## Cot, Cosec

Now finally we construct a third right angle triangle, but this time around the arc of the circle that covers theta's complementary angle.

Once again we have a tangent line, but in this case it's the tangent of the complimentary angle, which we cal the complimenetary tangent, cotangent, or cot for short.

We also have a secant line of the the complementary angle which we will call the complimentary secant, cosec or csc for short. And our third line is the radius 1.

Now, this right angle triangle is also similar to our first two right angle triangles because it also has the theta as well.

So let's do the same exercise and substitute our sides into the ratios, being careful to use the sides relative to theta and not the complementary angle.

## Summary
Now we have a whole bunch of different expressions for the 6 different side ratios of a right angle triangle. In fact, we could make a lot more expressions using substitution and the pythagorean theorem. But most commonly, we usually remember just a few of these, and understand we can derive the rest from them. So let's remove some of the less common ratios, and we are left with

The sine is the opposite over the hypotenuse, the cosine is the adjacent over the hypotenuse, the tangent is the opposite over the adjacent, and is often useful to remember it can be a function of the sine and cosine. The cosec, sec and cot are then the reciprocals of the sin, cosine and tangent.






# RESET
So how do these lines relate to the ratios in a triangle?

We start with a quarter circle of radius 1, around which we construct a right angle triangle such that the hypotenuse is tangent to the circle, and touches the circle at some angle theta.

Now, we have two right angle triangles, and using complementary angles, we can show that the top angle is also angle theta, meaning both right angle triangles are similar and have the same corresponding side ratios.

Also, because the triangles have a side length equal to one, some of those ratios will have a 1 in their denominator, simplifying them down to a single side.

So now, let's name our sides relative to theta.

Firstly, we will call side that covers or subtends theta in the first triangle the tangent, or just tan. The third line of this triangle is a secant line that cuts through the circle, so we call it the sec.

Let's now fill in our opposite over ajcent ratio. The side opposite theta is the tan line, whose length is a function of theta, and the adjacent side is 1.

Similarly, we can see our hypotenuse over adjacent is the sec line over one, where the sec length is also a function of theta, leaving us with just the sec.

And in fact, these two ratios are most often called the tan function and sec function.

Let's now look at our second triangle.

This triangle also has a tangent line, but this time it covers the complementary angle. Therefore we will call it the complementary tangent, cotangent or cot for short.

Similarly the we have a complimentary secant line, which we call the cosec or csc for short.

We can now fill in two more ratios, being careful to fill them in relative to theta and not the complementary angle, so the side adjacent to theta over the opposite side is equal to the cot, whose lenght is a function of theta over 1, or simply the cot, and the hypotenuse over the opposite is the cosec.

Now our final two ratios have the hypotenuse as the denominator so we need to construct a similar right angle triangle with the radius as the hypotenuse. Now this line is a half cord line, and in fact when these ratios were developed it was called the half chord or half bowstring. However, as the concept was translated into Latin, the original meaning was lost, and the Latin word sinus meaning bay or bossom was used to describe this line. As a result our word today is the sine, or sin comes from this. But we can think of it as a half cord as that is what it is.

So now our opposite over hypotenuse ratio is the sine, whose length is a function of theta, over one or just the sine.

Finally, we will draw the sine of the complementary angle, which we will call the cosine or cos for short. And with it, we see our last ratio is simply the cos.

And so these are the names we use today for each of these ratios. The names come from the relationship between right angle triangles, complementary angles and circles. This diagram not only helps us understand where the names comes from, but also helps us get an intuitive understanding of what these ratios values are, and how they are bounded.







So let's name our sides relative to the angle theta. First we will name the tangent line that subtends the angle theta, tan (from tangent). And the

Now our second triangle also has a tangent line, but it covers the complementary angle, so we will call it the complementary tan, or cotan or cot for short. And our final line is the complementary secant line, or which we call the cosec or csc.














# From before


# Where we are going
This video is going to build up to this geometry which shows the relationship between the trigonometric functions. You can move the radius and see how the length of the lines which corresponds with teh value of the functions change, and hopefully draw out some insights that are in there in the mathematics, but maybe not quite as tangible as when you see and play with a diagram that shows them.

In this video, we will build up this diagram that relates the trigonometric functions. Along the way we will see why the trigonometric functions exist, where their names come from and then use this diagram to get insights into the relationships between the functions. YOu can get the same insights from looking at the math of the relationships, but for some, like myself, different insights pop out in different ways. Interacting with this diagram make it obvious to me that the sec and cosec cannot exist between -1 and 1. For instance, using this diagram you can see that the cosine and sine are limited to within + and minus 1. In contrast the sec and cosec can be any value between -inf and +inf except between + and minus 1. Such insights are clear from the math, but studying the 

# Similar Triangles
*Really drive home the last point*
We first need to review properties of similar triangles.

Two triangles are similar when they have the same set of angles, and have corresponding side lengths that are scaled by the same factor. This then helps us understand a third property, which is the ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles will be equal. So if we take the ratio of sides sA and sB from the bottom triangle, the s term cancels and we are left with the same ratio as sides A and B from the top triangle. These properties are a consequence of each other, and so triangles with any of these properties will have all of these properties and be similar.

# Right Angle Triangles
The trigonometric functions come from studying the relationship between sides and angles in a right angle triangle.

So what does this mean for right angle triangles?

Well, by definition as we know one angle is a right angle, when we define one more angle theta, then because angles in a triangle always add to 180ยบ, we are effectively defining all three angles.

So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta have the same set of angles.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will be similar.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios.
