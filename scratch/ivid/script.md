* This triangle is interactive. You can drag the top corner or rotate the hypotenuse to make different triangles. When you interact with it, the video will pause, so press play when you're ready to continue.


* Now, let's look at the values of all the possible side ratios as we change the triangle.

* Try making different triangles and see how the ratios change. Can you find a way to change the triangle that keeps the ratios constant?

* Well, if we are careful and change the size of the triangle without changing the angle theta, we can see the ratios stay constant.
* This seems to work for any angle, like small angles... and large angles.

* Why is this?


* Well, we might remember from geometry, that a triangle's angles sum to 180ยบ, so when we define two angles, in this case the right angle and theta, we are really defining all three.

* Therefore all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have the same set of angles and be similar triangles.

* Now, a property of similar triangles is that all similar triangles will have equal corresponding side ratios.
>> So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios. 
* So for example if we label two sides on the left triangle, and take their ratio, then the corresponding sides of the right triangle will have the same ratio. Similarly, if we label the third side, the ratio between the first and third sides will be the same for both triangles, and this holds for any side ratio.

* So this explains why all the ratios stay constant when the angle stays the same.

* In fact, we can see the ratios only change when we change the angle - and therefore we can say the ratios are dependent on, or a function of angle, which we've called theta.

* These functions are used frequently in trigonometry, and so they each have a special abreviated name - the sin, cos, tan, sec, csc and cot, and as a collection they are often called trigonometric functions.

* The next video in this series will show where these names come from.
