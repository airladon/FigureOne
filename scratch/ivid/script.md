* This triangle is interactive. You can drag the top corner or rotate the hypotenuse to make different triangles. When you interact with it, the video will pause, so press play when you're ready to continue.


* Now as we change the triangle, let's look at the all the possible side ratio values.

* Try making different triangles and see how the ratios change. Can you find a way to change the triangle that keeps the ratios constant?

* Well, if we are careful and change the size of the triangle without changing the angle theta, we can see the ratios stay constant.
* This seems to work for any angle, like small angles... and large angles.

* Why is this?


* Well, we might remember from geometry, that a triangle's angles sum to 180ยบ, so when we define two angles, in this case the right angle and theta, we are really defining all three.

* Therefore all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have the same set of angles and be similar triangles.

* Now, a property of similar triangles is that all similar triangles will have equal corresponding side ratios.
>> So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios. 
* So for example if we label two sides on the left triangle, and take their ratio, then the corresponding sides of the right triangle will have the same ratio. Similarly, if we label the third side, the ratio between the first and third sides will be the same for both triangles, and this holds for any side ratio.

* So this explains why all the ratios stay constant when the angle stays the same, even if the triangle size changes.

* In fact, we can see the ratios *only* change when we change the angle - and therefore we can say the ratios are dependent on, or a function of angle, which we've called theta.

* These functions are used frequently in trigonometry, and so they each have a special abreviated name - the sin, cos, tan, sec, csc and cot, and as a collection they are often called trigonometric functions.

* The next video in this series will show where these names come from.




>> Show cos/sin right triangle, then kite right triangles, then polygon inside right triangle. Name polygon side half-side, equating to sine
* In geometry, Right angle triangles can be used to analyze various points, lines and geometries associated with circles. In some situation the resulting triangle has side lengths that *are* the trigonometric functions, and these situations lead to the names given to them.

>> show tangent triangle, then dissolve in outside polygon, and outside kit
* Take for example this triangle, which you might find in numerous geometries. When the circle has radius 1, when it is a unit circle, then the ratios with the adjacent side in the denominator will will simplify. So, what are do we call these side lengths then?

* Well a line that *touches* the circle at one point, and is perpendicular to the radius line at the same point, is called a *tangent* line, where the word tangent comes from the latin word meaning *to touch*. The line opposite theta is a tangent line, and we will call it just tan for short. The tan line is a function of theta, as when we change theta the length changes, but for simplicity, we will leave theta off.

* Next, a line that *cuts* through the circle is called a *secant* line, where the word secant comes from the latin word meaning *to cut*.

* And so we call the line that cuts through the circle to the tan line the secant, or just sec for short, remembering the sec is also a function of theta.

* And so our two trigonometric ratios with adjacent in the bottom are the tan and sec functions.

>> To find the remaning functions, we need to find other right angle triangles where the hypotenuse and then the opposite side is 1.

* Next, let's look at a right angle triangle within the circle. This right angle triangle can be used to analyze a *chord* line, where the word *chord* comes from the Latin word meaning *bowstring*. This means the vertical line of the triangle is a half chord, and while originally in Sanskrit it was called just that, a half chord or half bowstring, it was later translated into Latin where it lost this meaning. Our word today sine, comes from this Latin translation, though we often abreviate it without the e.



our word sine comes from the Latin translation that lost this meaning. And so we can label our side the sin, where we often abreviate it without the e.
