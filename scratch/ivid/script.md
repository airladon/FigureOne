* This triangle is interactive. You can drag the top corner around to make different triangles, or you can rotate the hypotenuse, keeping its length constant while changing the angle theta. When you interact with it, the video will pause, so press play when you're ready to continue.

* Now, let's look at the different side ratio values as we change the triangle.

* Try making different triangles and see how the ratios change. For instance, try making different triangles with the same angle and see how the ratios change. Also, try changing the angle, and see how the ratios change. Can you explain what you see?

* If we are careful and change the size of the triangle without changing the angle theta, we can see the ratios stay constant.
* This works for any angle, so let's try another.

* On the other hand when we change the angle, we can see the ratios change.
* In other words, the ratios are a function of angle theta, and size does not seem to change the ratio.
* Why?
* Well, as a triangle's angles add to 180ยบ, then if you define two angles in a triangle, in this case theta and the right angle, the complementary angle of theta is also defined.

* Therefore all right angle triangles with the angle theta will have the same set of angles and be similar.

* Now, a property of similar triangles is that all similar triangles will have equal corresponding side ratios.

* In other words, all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios, and this explains why our ratios are staying the same for constant theta.

* Each of these ratios has a special abreviated name: sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, and cot, and they are commonly referred to as the trigonometric functions.

* The next video in this series will show where these names come from.
