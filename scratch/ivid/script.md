# Introduction
Welcome to this interactive video describing where the trigonometric functions come from. This video is interactive, which means if you see me interacting with an element on the screen, then you can too. When you do, the video will pause, so just press play when you are ready to continue.

# Similar Triangles
To understand where the trigonometric functions come from, we first need to remember properties that similar triangles have.

Two triangles are said to be similar when they have the same shape, but are of different size. This means, their corresponding angles are all equal, so they have the same shape, and their corresponding sides are all scaled by the same amount. This then helps us understand the third property, which is the ratio of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles will be equal. So if we take the ratio of sides sA and sB, the s term cancels and we are left with the same ratio as sides A and B from the top triangle. Finally, if you can show triangles have any of these properties, then in fact those two triangle will be similar, and will have all of the properties.

# Right Angle Triangles
So what does this mean for right angle triangles?

Well, by definition as we know one angle is a right angle, when we define one more angle theta, then because angles in a triangle always add to 180ยบ, we are effectively defining all three angles.

So we can say all right angle triangles with the same angle theta have the same set of angles.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will be similar.

Meaning that all right angle triangles with the same angle theta will have equal corresponding side ratios.

# Ratios
So that means for instance that the ratio between the side opposite theta and the hypotenuse is the same value for all right triangles with the same angle theta.

It also means the ratio between the side adjacent to theta and the hypotenuse is the same for all right triangles with theta.

And similarly we can say the same for all the different possible side ratios.

Now, the ratio values all change with angle and as we change theta between 0 and 90 degrees, we can see how the ratio values change. This means each ratio is dependent on, or a function of theta. 

# Names
## Lines
Each of these functions have abreviated names that come directly from Latin, so the names are not necessarily intuitive. However, the names are all derived from just three different lines related to a circle, and knowing these lines can help make sense of the names.

The first line is the chord, and is a line between two points on a circle. The word chord comes from the latin word meaning bowsting, and you might see a bow when you highlight the arc between the cord.

The second line touches the circle in just one spot and is called a tangent line coming from the latin word meaning to touch. The tangent line has the property that it is at right angles to the radius line that touches the same point.

The third line cuts through the circle and is called a secant line coming from the latin word meaning to cut.

So, how do these three lines relate to our triangle ratios?

## Sin, Tan, Sec
Well if we take a circle with radius one, also called a unit circle, and define an arc with some angle theta, then we can draw a right angle triangle within the arc, and one outside of the arc and we can see and label some of these lines.

Firstly, we can see a line that touches the circle at one point and is perpendicular to the radius, and so is a tangent line, which we will abreviate as tan.

We can see a line that cuts through the circle, a secant line, which we will call sec.

And we can see part of a chord line. Now, using geometry you can show this is actually half of a chord, and it was called a half chord or half bowstring when these concepts were first developed in Sanskrit by Indian Mathematitians. Now our word today sine, comes from the Latin translation of this which unfortunately lost the original meaning. Maybe it would make more sense to be called a half-chord, but nevertheless, sine is the word we use and we usually abreviate this without the e.

Now, let's substitude these names into ratios where the unit circle simplifies the result.

Firstly, our inside right angle triangle has an opposite side over hypotenuse ratio equal to sin over 1, as the hypotenuse is the radius of length 1. This simplifies down to just the sine, and consequently this ratio is called the sine function.

Next, our outside right angle triangle has an opposite side over adjacent side ratio equal to tan over 1, as here the adjacent side is the radius of length 1, which in turn simplifies down to just the tan, and so this ratio is called the tan function.

Thirdly, the outside right angle trianlge has a hypotenuse over adjacent side ratio equal to sec over 1, resulting in this ratio being called the sec function.

## Cos, Cot, Csc
Now, we are going to construct inside and outside right angle triangles around the complementary angle of theta.

These triangles 

The names of our three remaining ratios come from the similar triangles created from the complementary angle of theta.

So, we start with our complementary angle, and construct our inside and outside triangles.

This means we have a tangent of the complmentary angle

Now if we look at our remaining ratios, we can see each one is just a reciprocal of one we've already named, nevertheless they all have individual names, and all these names come from the concept of a complementary angle
