## **[Interactive Angle](https://github.com/airladon/FigureOne/tree/master/docs/examples/Interactive%20Angle)**

A dynamic angle that changes its size, position and orientation with user interaction.

## **[Pythagorean Equation Animation](https://github.com/airladon/FigureOne/tree/master/docs/examples/Pythagorean%20Theorem)**

Setup the problem with animation, then step through the working at your own pace.

## **[Create a Sine Wave](https://github.com/airladon/FigureOne/tree/master/docs/examples/Sine%20Wave)**

See how sine waves and rotation are related with interaction and animation.

## **[Total Angle of a Polygon](https://github.com/airladon/FigureOne/tree/master/docs/examples/Total%20Angle%20of%20a%20Polygon)**

Press on the different terms of an equation to see where they come from, then step through the simplification.

## **[Sine Limit](https://github.com/airladon/FigureOne/tree/master/docs/examples/Sine%20Limit)**

Step through the reasoning behind why the sine of a small angle is approximately equal to the small angle.
