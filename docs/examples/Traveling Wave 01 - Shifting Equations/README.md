## Notes

There are numerous shapes, equations and descriptions in this example, and as such it is one of the largest ones. Similar to other examples, this example has three main parts:
- Layout definitions of the shapes and equations
- Logic for animations and updating interactive slides
- Slide definitions

Looking at some of th
with almost 400 lines being just dedicated to making the slides of the [SlideNavigator](https://airladon.github.io/FigureOne/api/#slidenavigator).

This example doesn't introduce any new concepts compared to the tutorials or other examples.
