## Code
`index.js`
```js
const figure = new Fig.Figure();

const pow = () => {
  const xValues = Fig.tools.math.range(0, 10, 0.05);
  return xValues.map(x => [x, x ** 2]);
};

// Plot of single trace with auto axis scaling
figure.add({
  method: 'collections.plot',
  trace: pow(),
});
```

## Explanation

Plotting can be as simple, or as customized as desired. This example shows the simplest way to plot out a trace.

A trace is an array of points, that will be plotted against an x and y axis. While axes can be fully customized, this example uses auto generated axes that will show the entire trace.

The trace is defined by:

```js
const pow = () => {
  const xValues = Fig.tools.math.range(0, 10, 0.05);
  return xValues.map(x => [x, x ** 2]);
};
```

This generates a range of x axis values from 0 to 10, and calculates the corresponding y values as the square of x. Of course, any array of points can be used, and this is just an example.

The plot is then generated by passing the trace values into the 'options.trace' property:

```js
// Plot of single trace with auto axis scaling
figure.add({
  method: 'collections.plot',
  trace: pow(),
});
```

Note, the method used to generate the plot is `'collections.plot'`. All of the figure elements in previous tutorials have been [FigureElementPrimitive](https://airladon.github.io/FigureOne/api/#figureelementprimitive)s. These are relatively simple shapes.

FigureOne also has a suite of more complex shapes that are [FigureElementCollection](https://airladon.github.io/FigureOne/api/#figureelementcollection)s. These manage a number of other figure elements to create more rich and detailed shapes. Often additional methods and animations are included in the collections to make interactivity and animation more convenient.

A list of available collections is [here](https://airladon.github.io/FigureOne/api/#shape-collections).
