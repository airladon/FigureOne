This video is interactive. At anytime during the video you can interact with the shapes on the screen. You can touch and drag the middle of the shapes to move them, and touch and drag the edges of the shapes to rotate them. Whenever you touch something, the video will pause, so press play when you're ready to continue.

So, we have three stacks of regular polygons with 4, 6 and 12 sides respectively.

Can you arrange them so there is no white space, or overlap between the shapes?

So for example, if we use only squares, we can align them all and nicely fill in an area with no overlap and no gaps.

Similarly, we can do the same if we use just hexagons. Once again we have no overlap and no spaces.

However, for the dodecagons, we cannot tile them with no overlap or white space, as we are left with a little triangle of white space.

To create a tiling with the dodecagons, you are going to need to use the other two shapes as well. Try moving them around, and rotating them where necessary to find the tiling.
