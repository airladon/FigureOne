FigureOne provides a number of collections shapes that combine simple shapes into more complex objects.

Collections shapes are {@link FigureElementCollection}s that manage a number of {@link FigureElement}s, and may provide methods to dynamically update and change the shapes, additional animation steps specific to to shape, and additional ways to interact with the shape.
