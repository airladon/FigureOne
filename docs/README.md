## Introduction

This will introduce some key terms and concepts that are found frequently throughout the documentation.

#### Diagrams, Primitives and Collections

**FigureOne** allows you to create a _figure_, or _diagram_ that can be both interactive and animated.

A diagram has one or more _diagram elements_. A diagram element is a simple shape, some text, or it may be a collection of other elements. These elements combine to create a complex drawing, graph or equation.

In the language of **FigureOne**, there are two types of [DiagramElements][739]:

-   [DiagramElementPrimitive][54] - an element that will draw something to the screen, such as a line, shape or text
-   [DiagramElementCollection][58] - collections of primitives or other collections

Each [DiagramElement][14] has a [Transform][207] that may contain one or more translations, rotations and scaling factors. When the element is rendered to the screen, the transform will be applied. In the case of a [DiagramElementPrimitive][54], the shape or text will be transformed. In the case of a [DiagramElementCollection][58], all the diagram elements it contains will have the transform applied to them.

This means there is a heierachy of [DiagramElement][14] objects, where the parent transform is applied to (cascaded with) the child transform. Therefore collections can be thought of as modular building blocks of a more complex figure.

Changing an element's transform moves the element through space. Changing the element's transform over time animates the element.

#### An Example

Let's say we want to create a rotating labeled line. As the line is rotated, the label follows the line.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/ex1.png"></p>

To create this diagram, we might use a diagram element hierarchy like:

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/ex1-hierarchy.png"></p>

The drawn elements, the line and text, are primitives. They are created in the simple no rotation case. If the line is 0.8 long, and it starts at (0, 0), then the text might be at (0.4, 0.1)

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/ex1-collection.png"></p>

The diagram itself has limits that define the coordinate window that can be shown, in this case its bottom left is the origin, and it is 3 wide and 2 high. We want the collection to be rotated, with the center of rotation at the center of the diagram. Therefore we apply a rotation and translation transform to the collection.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/ex1-diagram.png"></p>

There are several different ways to create the same diagram, but this way is used as it highlights how a collection can be used to transform a group of primitive elements.

#### Coordinate spaces

FigureOne renders shapes in WebGL, text in Context2D and can even manipulate html elements as diagram elements. As WebGL is used most in FigureOne, it will be used as an example to introduce coorindate spaces and why they matter.

WebGL is rendered in a html [canvas][740] element.

The [canvas][740] element is defined in screen pixels. The WebGL view re-maps the canvas pixels to -1 to +1 coordinates in both the vertical and horizontal directions, independent on the aspect ratio of the canvas.

When the canvas aspect ratio is not a square, or it is more convenient to create a diagram in a coordinate space not mapped between -1 to +1, then it is useful to have a separate _diagram space_. In the example above, the diagram space re-maps the _GL space_ to 0 to 3 in the horizontal and 0 to 2 in the vertical.

These are three examples of different coordinate spaces - _pixel space_, _GL space_ and _diagram space_.

If you want to move or modify an element, you need to think about what you want to modify it _relative_ to. Do you want to move it relative to other elements in the diagram? In other words, do you want to move it in _diagram space_? Or do you want to move it relative to other elements within the parent, or local collection - _local space_. Alternately, you might want to modify the vertices of the shape, in _vertex space_.

In simple diagrams, where no collections are used, or collections don't transform their child elements you don't really need to think about what space you are working in. Diagram space will be the same as local space and vertex space. You won't care about the higher level GL or pixel spaces.

But if you have transformed collections, or if you are tying an element to a location on the screen you will need to convert points between the different spaces. In addition, it is useful to know about these different spaces as sometimes they are referred to in the documentation.

One way to think about what space you are modifying is:

-   Elements that are direct children of the diagram: element transforms are in diagram space
-   Elements that are direct children of a collection: element transforms are in local space (the space of the parent colleciton)
-   Vertex definitions in element primitives: vertex space

For example, a square might be defined in vertex space as a square with length 1, centered around the origin.

The transform of the diagram element primitive that controls the square will move the square in _local space_ - the space relative to all other elements that are the children of the same parent collection.

If the parent collection's parent is the diagram itself, then its transform will move the colleciton in diagram space.

Converting between spaces is relatively straight forward. All diagram elements have methods to find their position or bounds in _diagram_, _local_ or _vertex_ space. The diagram has transforms that allow conversion between _diagram_, _GL_ and _pixel_ spaces.

Where this is useful is if two primitives have different parents, and you want to move one to be in the same position as the other. To do this you would convert the target element position to _diagram space_, and then to the _local space_ of the element to move.

#### Drawing

When it is time to draw the scene, the diagram will pass an initial transform to the first element in the hierarchy. In the example above, the "Labeled Line" collection. This transform will include any translations and scaling needed to convert from _diagram_ space to _GL_ space for actual rendering.

The "Labeled Line" collection will then cascade this transform with it's own rotation and translation transform, and pass this to its children, the "Label" and "Line" primitives.

The "Label" primitive has it's own transform that translates it to the middle of the horizontal line in _local_ space. The transform will be combined with the one from its parent, creating a final transform to draw the label with.

The primitive's shape or text definition never needs to change. At draw time, it is simply transformed by it's own transform and all the ancestors directly above it in the hierarchy. This is the same method used by WebGL as it reduces the amount of memory that needs to be loaded into the graphics memory each draw frame. All the vertices of a shape are loaded into the graphics memory just once, and each frame just a transform is passed informs the graphics processor how to orient the vertices.

If you have a dynamic shape whose vertices do change every frame (like a morphing animation), you can choose to load the vertices every frame. However, depending on the performance of the browser's host machine, and the number of vertices being adjusted, you might see a performance impact compared to a shape with a similar amount of vertices that do not change.

#### Code

Finally, let's see the code for the example above. Two files, `index.html` and `index.js` should be in the same folder.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
    <div id="figureOneContainer" style="width: 1200px; height: 800px; background-color: white;">
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/figureone@0.2.3/figureone.min.js'></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='./index.js'></script>
</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// index.js
const diagram = new Fig.Diagram({ limits: [0, 0, 6, 4 ]});
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 'labeledLine',
    method: 'collection',
    addElements: [
      {
        name: 'line',
        method: 'line',
        options: {
          p1: [0, 0],
          p2: [2, 0],
          width: 0.01,
          color: [0, 0, 1, 1],
        },
      },
      {
        name: 'label',
        method: 'text',
        options: {
          text: 'Line 1',
          position: [1, 0.1],
          font: { color: [0, 0, 1, 1] },
          xAlign: 'center',
        },
      },
    ],
    options: {
      position: [3, 2],
    },
    mods: {
      isTouchable: true,
      isMovable: true,
      touchInBoundingRect: true,
      move: {
        type: 'rotation',
      },
    },
  },
);
diagram.elements.isTouchable = true;
diagram.initialize();
```

#### Using FigureOne

The example above shows how a figure can be defined with simple javascript objects, able to be encoded simply in JSON. This means complex figures or modules can be shared and reused easily.

For many uses, it is fine to fully define a diagram and all its elements before a user interacts with it.

Diagrams can also be defined more dynamically, such as in the example below which has exactly the same function as the example above.

```javascript
// index.js
const diagram = new Fig.Diagram({ limits: [0, 0, 6, 4 ]});
diagram.initialize();

const label = diagram.create.text({
  text: 'Line 1',
  position: [1, 0.1],
  font: { color: [0, 0, 1, 1] },
  xAlign: 'center',
});
const line = diagram.create.line({
  p1: [0, 0],
  p2: [2, 0],
  width: 0.01,
  color: [0, 0, 1, 1],
});
const labeledLine = diagram.create.collection({});
diagram.elements.add('labeledLine', labeledLine);

## Diagram




## Diagram

Class to create a diagram.

By default, a diagram will attach a WebGL canvas and Context2D
canvas to the html `div` element with id `"figureOneContainer"`.

To attach to a different `div`, use the `htmlId` property in the class
constructor.

The diagram manages all drawing elements, rendering the drawing elements
on browser animation frames and listens for guestures from the user.

The diagram also has a recorder, allowing to record and playback states,
and gestures.

If a diagram is paused, then all drawing element animations will
also be paused.

It also has a number of convenience functions for create drawing elements
already attached to the drawing canvases, and useful transforms for
converting between the different spaces (e.g. pixel, GL, diagram).

## Diagram Elements




## DiagramElement

Diagram Element base class

The set of properties and methods shared by all diagram elements

A diagram element has several color related properties. Color is
defined as an RGBA array with values between 0 and 1. The alpha
channel defines the transparency or opacity of the color where
1 is fully opaque and 0 is fully transparent.

The `color` property stores the element's current color, while the
`defaultColor` property stores the element's color when not dimmed or
dissolving. Color should only be set using the `setColor` method.

An element can be "dimmed" or "undimmed". For instance,
a red element might turn grey when dimmed. The property
`dimColor` stores the desired color to dim to and should be set with
`setDimColor()`

An element can be dissolved in or out with animation. Dissolving
an element out transitions its opacity from its current value to 0.
The `opacity` property is used when dissolving. The opacity is multiplied by
the alpha channel of `color` to net a final opacity. Opacity should not be
set directly as it will be overwritten by dissolve animations.

## Geometric Classes

To define many shapes, geometric primitives (not to be confused with diagram element primitives) such as points and lines need to be used.

FigureOne includes classes that define a:

-   [Point][71]
-   [Line][124]
-   <a href="#rect">Rectangle</a>
-   [Translation][171] transform
-   [Rotation][183] transform
-   [Scale][77] transform
-   <a href="transform">Transform Chain</a>

Each of these classes have convenience methods that make it easy to to work with them such as

-   Checking if two points are equal or within some delta
-   Adding, subtracting and multiplying points
-   Checking if a point is on a line
-   Finding the intersection between two lines
-   Transforming a point with a transform
-   Chaining transforms together

There are many more methods in each class and it is recommended you quickly review them so you know what is available and don't need to reimplement existing logic.

Many of these classes are used by each other. For instance, [Line][124] makes a lot of use of [Point][71]. Therefore instead of defining a point by creating a class each time, short hand, parsable equivalents for Points, Lines, Rectangles and Transforms are available. For more information refer to:

-   [TypeParsablePoint][589]
-   [TypeParsableLine][591]
-   [TypeParsableRect][593]
-   [TypeParsableTransform][595]

above a horizontal line defined from right to left. Another way to think of
it is if lines are used to create a polygon in the positive rotation
direction (CCW), the the `'positive'` side will be on the outside of the
polygon.

`'negative'` is then the inside of the same polygon.

#### Parameters

-   `precision` **[number][752]**  (optional, default `8`)

Returns **[boolean][751]** 

### intersectsWith

The intersection between this line and `line2`.

The returned result is an [Intersect][679] object with keys `intersect`,
`alongLine` and `withinLine`. The `intersect` is found by extending both
lines to infinity and recording where they cross. If the two lines never
cross, and are not collinear, then the result will be `undefined`.
`alongLine` and `withinLine` can then be used as metadata to defermine if
the intersection is within finite lines or not.

The properties of the two lines, such as whether they have zero, finite,
or infinite length, and are parallel or collinear will define the result.

If the lines are not parallel and/or collinear then the returned intercept
will be the point where the two lines, extended to infinity, cross. The
`withinLine` returned property can then be used to determine if the
intercept point is within this line.

If one of the lines has zero length, then `intersect` will only be
defined if p1 of the zero length line lies along the other line.

If both of the lines have zero length, then `intersect` will only be
defined if p1 of both lines is the same.

If the lines are parallel and not collinear, then `intercept` will be
undefined.

If lines are collinear then the `intercept` point will be defined by how
many finite ends the lines have and wheter the lines are overlapping or
not

Lines are equal:

-   0 ends: take the yIntercept (or xIntercept if vertical)
-   1 ends: take the p1 point
-   2 ends: take the midPoint

One line within the other: take mid point between mid points

-   2 ends around 2 ends: take the midPoint of the two midPoints
-   0 ends around 2 ends: take the midPoint of the 2 ends
-   0 ends around 1 ends: take the p1 of the 1 ends
-   1 end around 1 end: take the midPoint between the p1s
-   1 end around 2 ends: take the midPoint of the two ends

Lines are not overlapping:

-   Both 2 ends - take midPoint between 2 closest ends
-   Both 1 ends - take midPoint between 2 p1s
-   One 1 end and 2 end - take midPoint between p1 and closest point

Lines are partially overlapping:

-   Both 2 ends - take midPoint between 2 overlapping ends
-   Both 1 ends - take midPoint between both p1s
-   One 1 end and 2 end - take midPoint between overlapping end and p1

## Drawing Shapes

Each [DiagramElementPrimitive][54] element manages drawing a shape, drawing text, or manipulating a HTML element.

FigureOne's built-in shapes are drawn using WebGL, which uses triangles to create different shapes. To draw a shape, you define the verticies of the triangles. Every drawing frame (animation or screen refresh), the color of the vertices and the transform that moves them around is used to render the final shape to the screen.

### <a id="drawing-boilerplate"></a> Drawing Boilerplate

To test examples within the 'Drawing Shapes' sections of the API reference create an `index.html` file and `index.js` file.

All examples are snippets which can be appended to the end of the `index.js` file.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
    <div id="figureOneContainer" style="width: 800px; height: 800px; background-color: white;">
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/figureone@0.2.3/figureone.min.js'></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='./index.js'></script>
</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// index.js
const diagram = new Fig.Diagram({ limits: [-3, -3, 6, 6]});
```

### Quick Start

Let's start by creating a [DiagramElementPrimitive][54] element that draws a polygon and adding it to the diagram.

```javascript
// create the `DiagramElementPrimitive`
const p = diagram.create.polygon({
  radius: 0.2,
  fill: true,
  color: [0, 0, 1, 1],
  sides: 6,
});
// add it to the diagram
diagram.elements.add('p', p);
```

Another way to create and add the same shape to the diagram is to use the `Diagram.addElement` or `Diagram.addElements` method:

```javascript
diagram.addElement({
  name: 'p',
  method: 'polygon',
  options: {
    radius: 0.2,
    fill: true,
    color: [0, 0, 1, 1],
    sides: 6,
  },
});
```

Both ways create the same element. The first way is more programatic and especially useful when extending shape creation classes. In comparison, the second way can allow you to layout an entire diagram in a single object that is compatible with JSON. This means it is relatively straight forward to share diagram elements between projects. When using code folding in an IDE, the second way also makes it easy to work with diagrams with many elements.

For most of the API reference, the second way will be used.

### Built-in Shapes

There are several built in shape methods that can be used to create complex diagrams:

-   <a href="#obj_line">line</a>
-   <a href="#obj_polyline">polyline</a>
-   <a href="#obj_triangle">triangle</a>
-   <a href="#obj_rectangle">rectangle</a>
-   <a href="#obj_polygon">polygon</a>

### Drawing a generic shape

While there are several built-in shapes such as polygons, rectangles and polylines in FigureOne, there is also a 'generic' method that will allow creation of any shape.

To use the generic method however, it is important to understand how WebGL uses triangles to create shapes.

Any shape can be quantized into triangles. For instance, the digram below shows a rectangle broken into two triangles with vertices labeled.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/draw/rect.png"></p>

To draw this shape, you would need to draw the two triangles, which means drawing 6 vertices:

-   1, 2, 3
-   1, 3, 4

```javascript
diagram.addElement({
  name: 'rectangle',
  method: 'generic',
  options: {
    points: [
      [-2, -1], [-2, 1], [2, 1],
      [-2, -1], [2, 1], [2, -1],
    ],
    drawType: 'triangles',
  },
});
```

This method will be able to draw almost anything.

However, for some shapes there are simpler ways to draw the same thing with fewer repeated vertices.

#### drawType: 'strip'

A strip starts with one triangle, and then every subsequent vertex will create a triangle with the last two vertices.

Therefore, to draw the same rectangle we would draw the first triangle with the vertices 2, 1 and then 3. Then 1 and 3 could be used with 4 to create the second triangle.

```javascript
diagram.addElement({
  name: 'rectangle',
  method: 'generic',
  options: {
    points: [
      [-2, 1], [-2, -1], [2, 1],  // first triangle
      [2, -1],                    // second triangle formed with vertices 1 and 3
    ],
    drawType: 'strip',
  },
});
```

This method works well for continuous shapes, but will not work for shapes that have gaps.

A good example of a shape that works with `'strip'` is below. The vertices are labeled in the order they would be defined.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/draw/strip.png"></p>

#### drawType: 'fan'

A fan starts with one point. The next two points create the first triangle, and then every subsequent point uses the first and last point to create the next triangle.

Therefore, to draw the same rectangle we would draw the first point 1, then complete the first triangle with 2 and 3. Then we would draw point 4 to make the second triangle with points 1 and 3.

```javascript
diagram.addElement({
  name: 'rectangle',
  method: 'generic',
  options: {
    points: [
      [-2, -1],         // first point (vertex 1)
      [-2, 1], [2, 1],  // complete first triangle (vertices 2, 3)
      [2, -1],          // second triangle formed with first and last vertex (1, 3)
    ],
    drawType: 'fan',
  },
});
```

This method works for any shape that can be broken into triangles that all share a common point. For example:

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/draw/fan.png"></p>

Note, `'strip'` can create any shape `'fan'` can, but it can be a little more involved. For instance, the shape above would need to duplicate one of the vertices to fully fill it:

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/draw/strip-fan.png"></p>

#### drawType: 'lines'

`'lines'` is the final style that WebGL accepts for drawing primitives. In this case vertex pairs are used to create lines.

This is not useful for drawing filled shapes, but is useful for drawing thin outlines.

For instance, to draw a rectangle outline:

```javascript
diagram.addElement({
  name: 'rectangle',
  method: 'generic',
  options: {
    points: [
      [-2, -1], [-2, 1],  // left edge
      [-2, 1], [2, 1],    // top edge
      [2, 1], [2, -1],    // right edge
      [2, -1], [-2, -1],  // bottom edge
    ],
    drawType: 'lines',
  },
});
```

Options object for a [DiagramElementPrimitive][54] of a generic shape

`points` will define either triangles or lines which combine
to make the shape.

`drawType` defines what sort of triangles or lines the `points` make
and is analagous to WebGL [drawing primitives][770]
where the mapping between the two are:

-   `'triangles'`: TRIANGLES
-   `'strip'`: TRIANGLE_STRIP
-   `'fan'`: TRIANGLE_FAN
-   `'lines'`: LINES

The most useful, common and generic `drawType` is `'triangles'`
which can be used to create any shape.

The shape is colored with either `color` or `texture`.

The shape's points can be duplicated using the `copy` property
to conveniently create multiple copies (like grids) of shapes.

The shape will have a touch `border` which may also have `holes`
or areas where touching has no effect.

Line definition options object.

![][774]

A line can either be defined as two points `p1` and `p2`, or
a single points `p1`, a `length` and an `angle`.

The line has some `width` that will be filled on both sides
of the line points evenly (`'mid'`), or on one side only.
The line's `'positive'` side is the side to which it rotates toward
when rotating in the positive angle direction around `p1`.
Similarly the line's `'negative'` side is the opposite.

The line can be solid or dashed where dashing is defined as an
array of numbers. The first number is the length of solid line and the
second is the length of the gap. If a third number is defined, then it is
the length of the next solid line, and so on. The dash pattern will repeat.

The line can have arrows at one or both ends using the `arrow` property.

    numbers for dash line where first number is length of line, second number is
    length of gap and then the pattern repeats - can use more than one dash length
    and gap  - e.g. [0.1, 0.01, 0.02, 0.01] produces a lines with a long dash,
    short gap, short dash, short gap and then repeats.
-   `arrow` **([OBJ_Arrow][775] \| [ArrowHead][776])?** either an object defining custom
    arrows or a string representing the name of an arrow head style can be used.

Polyline shape options object

![][777]

A polyline is a series of lines that are connected end to end. It is defined
by a series of points which are the ends and corners of the polyline.

The series of points is a zero width ideal polyline, and so to see it we must
give it some width. This width can either be grown on one side of the
ideal polyline or grown on both sides of it equally.

Here we define a line's side as either the _positive_ side, or _negative_
side. If a line is defined from p1 to p2, then the _positive_ side is the
side where the line moves if it is rotated around p1 in the positive (counter
clockwise) direction. Thus the order of the points that define the line
defines which side is positive and negative. A polyline is made up of many
lines end to end, and thus itself will have a positive and negative side
dependent on the order of points.

Each point, or line connection, creates a corner that will have an _inside_
angle (&lt;180º) and an _outside_ angle (>180º or reflex angle).

Growing width on an outside corner can be challenging. As the corner becomes
sharper, the outside width joins at a point further and further from the
ideal corner. Eventually trucating the corner makes more visual sense
and therefore, a minimum angle (`minAutoCornerAngle`) is used to
specify when the corner should be drawn, and when it should be truncated.

By default, the border of the polyline is the line itself (`border` =
`'line'`). The border can also just be the points on the positive side of
the line, or the negative side of the line. This is useful for caturing
the hole shape of a closed polyline within a border. The border can also
be the encompassing rectangle of the polyline (`border` = `'rect'`) or
defined as a custom set of points.

The touch border can either be the same as the border (`'border'`), the
encompassing rect (`'rect'`), a custom set of points, or the same as the
line but with some buffer that effectively increases the width on both sides
of the line.

Triangle shape options object

![][778]

The most generic way to define a triangle is with three points (`points`
property). When using `points`, all the other properties that can also
define a triangle are ignored: `width`, `height`, `top`,
`SSS`, `ASA`, `AAS`, `SAS`, `direction`, `rotation`, `xAlign` and `yAlign`.

The other ways to define a triangle are (in order of highest override
preference to lowest if more than one is defined in the object):

-   `ASA` or Angle-Side-Angle
-   `SAS` or Side-Angle-Side
-   `AAS` or Angle-Angle-Side
-   `SSS` or Side-Side-Side
-   `width`, `height` and `top` location

All these methods also use `direction` to define the triangles, and
`rotation`, `xAlign` and `yAlign` to position the triangles. Each corner
and side of the triangle is indexed, and can be used for positioning.

![][779]

A triangle starts with an angle (a1) at (0, 0) and base side extending along
the x axis to a second angle a2. The base side is side 1 (s1).

Angles a1 and a2 exten the triangle above s1 if `direction` is `1`, and
below s1 when `direction` is `-1`.

s2, a3, and s3 are then the consecutive sides and angles.

Triangles can be defined with a combination of side length and angle using
`ASA`, `SAS`, `AAS` and `SSS`, where the first side or angle is s1 or a1
respectively, and the subsequent sides and angles progress consecutively.
For instance, `ASA` defines the angle a1, then side length s1, then angle
a2. `SSS` defines the side lenghts s1, s2 then s3. All these combinations of
three properties are sufficient to define a unique triangle completely.

When defining the triangle with `width`, `height` and `top`, the base side
s1 is the width, and the top point is either aligned with the `left`,
`center` or `right` of the base at some `height` above s1.

When defined, a triangle's a1 corner will be at (0, 0), and s1 will be along
the x axis. Next, a `rotation` can be applied to the triangle. A `rotation`
can either be a `number` rotating it relative to its definition, or relative
to one of its sides: s1, s2 or s3.

Finally, the triangle can be positioned (in vertex space) using `xAlign` and
`yAlign`. An `xAlign` of `'left'` will position the triangle so that it's
left most point will be at (0, 0). Similarly, a `yAlign` of `'top'` will
position the triangle so its top most point is at (0, 0). Triangles
can also be aligned by angles (corners) and side mid points. For instance, an
`xAlign` of `'a2'`, will position the a2 corner at x = 0. Similarly a
`yAlign` of `'s3'` will position the triangle vertically such that the mid
point of s3 is at y = 0. `'centroid'` is relative to the geometric center of
the triangle.

Once a triangle is defined and positioned in vertex space, it can then be
copied (`copy`) if more than one triangle is desired.

The triangle(s) can then be positioned (`position`) or transformed
(`transform`) in the DiagramElementPrimitive local space.

Triangles can either be a solid fill, texture fill or outline. When `line`
is not defined, the triangle will be filled.

## OBJ_Grid

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#drawing-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Grid shape options object

![][784]

A grid is a rectangle divided into a series of vertical and horizontal lines.

The rectangle is defined by `bounds`.

`xNum` and `yNum` can be used to defined a number of equally spaced lines
in the rectangle (including the edges).

Alternatively `xStep` and `yStep` can be used to define the spacing between
lines from the bottom left corner.

The line width and style is defined with `line`.

### Properties

-   `bounds` **[TypeParsableRect][746]?** rectangle definition
-   `xStep` **[number][752]?** distance between vertical lines in grid from
    left - use this instead of `xNum`.
-   `yStep` **[number][752]?** distance between horizontal lines in grid from
    bottom - use this instead of `yNum`
-   `xNum` **[number][752]?** number of vertical lines in grid including top and
    bottom lines - overrides xStep
-   `yNum` **[number][752]?** number of horizontal lines in grid including left
    and right lines - overrides yStep
-   `line` **[OBJ_LineStyle][781]?** line style options - do not use any corner
    options
-   `copy` **([Array][744]&lt;([CPY_Step][771] \| [string][743])> | [CPY_Step][771])?** make copies of
    the rectangle
-   `color` **[Array][744]&lt;[number][752]>?** (`[1, 0, 0, 1]`)
-   `texture` **[OBJ_Texture][772]?** Override color with a texture
-   `position` **[Point][758]?** convenience to override Transform translation
-   `transform` **[Transform][747]?** (`Transform('rectangle').standard()`)
-   `pulse` **([number][752] \| [OBJ_PulseScale][773])?** set the default pulse scale

### Examples

```javascript
// Grid defined by xStep and yStep
diagram.addElement({
  name: 'g',
  method: 'grid',
  options: {
    bounds: [-0.5, -0.5, 1, 1],
    xStep: 0.25,
    yStep: 0.25,
    line: {
      width: 0.03,
    },
  },
});
```

```javascript
// Grid defined by xNum and yNum with dashed lines
const grid = diagram.create.grid({
  bounds: [-0.5, -0.5, 1, 1],
  xNum: 4,
  yNum: 4,
  line: {
    width: 0.03,
    dash: [0.1, 0.02],
  },
});
diagram.elements.add('g', grid);
```

```javascript
// Grid of grids
diagram.addElement({
  name: 'g',
  method: 'grid',
  options: {
    bounds: [-0.7, -0.7, 0.6, 0.6],
    xNum: 4,
    yNum: 4,
    line: {
      width: 0.03,
    },
    copy: [
      { along: 'x', num: 1, step: 0.8},
      { along: 'y', num: 1, step: 0.8},
    ],
  },
});
```

## Drawing Text

FigureOne provides text layout for both simple text, and lines of text with rich formatting.

### <a id="text-boilerplate"></a> Text Boilerplate

To test examples within the 'Drawing Text' sections of the API reference create an `index.html` file and `index.js` file.

All examples are snippets which can be appended to the end of the `index.js` file.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
    <div id="figureOneContainer" style="width: 800px; height: 800px; background-color: white;">
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/figureone@0.2.3/figureone.min.js'></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='./index.js'></script>
</body>
</html>
```

A grid is included in this javascript file to make it obvious how text is aligned and justified

```javascript
// index.js
const diagram = new Fig.Diagram({ limits: [-3, -3, 6, 6]});
diagram.addElements([
  {
    name: 'origin',
    method: 'polygon',
    options: {
      radius: 0.01,
      line: { width: 0.01 },
      sides: 10,
      color: [0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 1]
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'gridMinor',
    method: 'grid',
    options: {
      bounds: [-3, -3, 6, 6],
      yStep: 0.1,
      xStep: 0.1,
      color: [0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 1],
      line: { width: 0.001 },
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'gridMajor',
    method: 'grid',
    options: {
      bounds: [-3, -3, 6, 6],
      yStep: 0.5,
      xStep: 0.5,
      color: [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1],
      line: { width: 0.004 }
    },
  },
]);
```

### Quick Start - `text`

Let's start by creating a [DiagramElementPrimitive][54] element that writes 'hello world' to the diagram.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/text/text.png"></p>

```javascript
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 'simpleText',
    method: 'text',
    options: {
      text: 'hello world',
      xAlign: 'center',
      yAlign: 'middle',
    },
  },
);
```

The text has been horizontally aligned to its center, and vertically aligned to its middle around its default location of `(0, 0)`.

As this is a [DiagramElementPrimitive][54], transforms can be applied to it, and it can be touched and moved. For instance, the example below will rotate the text when it is dragged with a touch from the user.

```javascript
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 'spinner',
    method: 'text',
    options: {
      text: 'hello world',
      xAlign: 'center',
      yAlign: 'middle',
      touchBorder: 0.5,   // add a touch buffer of 0.5 around the text
    },
    mods: {
      isTouchable: true,
      isMovable: true,
      move: { type: 'rotation' },
    }
  },
);
diagram.setTouchable();
```

The same `text` method can be used to create text at different locations.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/text/compass.png"></p>

```javascript
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 'compass',
    method: 'text',
    options: {
      text: [
        {
          text: 'North',
          location: [0, 0.5],
        },
        {
          text: 'East',
          location: [0.5, 0],
        },
        {
          text: 'South',
          location: [0, -0.5],
        },
        {
          text: 'West',
          location: [-0.5, 0],
        },
      ],
      xAlign: 'center',
      yAlign: 'middle',
    },
  },
);
```

See [OBJ_Text][287] to apply custom formatting to each element in the `text`, but note that all the text in a sinle element will have the same formatting.

### Arranging text in a line - `text.line`

Often a phrase of text will want to apply specific formatting to a word or part of the phrase.

The above example can be used to do this, but it is cumbersome as the locations of part of the phrase with different formatting will need to be experimented with.

Alternately, `text.line` can be used as it will automatically layout the text elements from left to right based on their calculated widths.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/text/text-line.png"></p>

```javascript
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 'formattedLine',
    method: 'text.line',
    options: {
      line: [
        'hello ',
        {
          text: 'world',
          font: { color: [0, 0, 1, 1], style: 'italic' },
        },
        ' it is great to meet you',
      ],
      xAlign: 'center',
      yAlign: 'middle',
    },
  },
);
```

See [OBJ_TextLine][290] for more options including how to superscript and subscript text, or move it out of the line layout completely.

### Rich lines - `text.lines`

`text.line` keeps the text and formatting definitions next to each other in the API.

When using more text, it is sometimes useful to split these in the API to make it easier to read the text.

`text.lines` uses the special character `'|'` to surround parts of a phrase that needs to me modified with custom formating. The modifier definitions are then provided later in the interface.

The same example above can be done with `text.lines`:

```javascript
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 'formattedLine',
    method: 'text.lines',
    options: {
      lines: [
        'hello |world| it is great to see you',
      ],
      modifiers: {
        world: {
          font: { color: [0, 0, 1, 1], style: 'italic' },
        }
      },
      xAlign: 'center',
      yAlign: 'middle',
    },
  },
);
diagram.setTouchable();
```

`text.lines` also allows for multiple lines of text to be laid out and justified.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/text/text-lines.png"></p>

```javascript
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 't',
    method: 'text.lines',
    options: {
      lines: [
        'This is the |first| line',
        'This is the |second| line - and it is long',
        'This is the |third| line'
      ],
      modifiers: {
        first: {
          font: { color: [0, 0, 1, 1], style: 'italic' },
        },
        second: {
          font: { color: [0, 0.6, 0.6, 1], style: 'italic' },
        },
        third: {
          font: { color: [1, 0, 1, 1], style: 'italic' },
        },
      },
      xAlign: 'center',
      yAlign: 'middle',
      justify: 'center',
    },
  },
);
```

For more properties of `text.lines` see [OBJ_TextLines][293].


## OBJ_Text

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#text-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

One or more text strings.

![][785]

![][786]

Simple text options object.

Use this to make a [DiagramElementPrimitive][54] that renders text.

`text` can either be a single string, or an array of
[OBJ_TextDefinition][610] objects to define multiple strings. Each string
can have a different location, alignment (`xAlign`, `yAlign`) and formatting.

[DiagramElementPrimitive][54] objects allow for a callback to be defined
when they are touched by a user. In text [DiagramElementPrimitive][54],
each string can have its own callback assigned using the `onClick` property
of [OBJ_TextDefinition][610]. In addition custom touch borders to make it
easier to click the strings can be defined.

Note: there is a slight performance improvement in including multiple
strings at different locations in the same [DiagramElementPrimitive][54],
rather than creating a [DiagramElementPrimitive][54] for each string.

### Properties

-   `text` **([string][743] \| [OBJ_TextDefinition][787] \| [Array][744]&lt;([string][743] \| [OBJ_TextDefinition][787])>)** text to draw, either as a single string or multiple strings in an array
-   `font` **[OBJ_Font][788]?** default font to apply to all text
-   `xAlign` **(`"left"` \| `"right"` \| `"center"`)?** default horizontal text
    alignment for `text` relative to `location` (default: `"left"`)
-   `yAlign` **(`"bottom"` \| `"baseline"` \| `"middle"` \| `"top"`)?** default
    vertical text alignment for `text` relative to `location` (default: `"baseline"`)
-   `color` **[Array][744]&lt;[number][752]>?** (default: `[1, 0, 0, 1`])
-   `position` **[TypeParsablePoint][757]?** if defined, overrides translation
    in transform
-   `transform` **[TypeParsableTransform][789]?** (default: `Transform('text').standard()`)
-   `border` **(`"text"` \| `"rect"` \| [Array][744]&lt;[Array][744]&lt;[TypeParsablePoint][757]>>)?** border can be custom (`Array<TypeParsablePoint>`), set to `'rect'` for the
    encompassing rectangle around all text borders combined,
    or set to `'text'` for the individual text borders (default: `'text'`)
-   `touchBorder` **(`"text"` \| `"rect"` \| [number][752] \| `"border"` \| [Array][744]&lt;[Array][744]&lt;[TypeParsablePoint][757]>>)?** touch border can be custom (`Array<TypeParsablePoint>`), set to `'rect'` for
    the encompassing rectangle around all text touch borders, set to `'text'`
    for the individual text touch borders (`'text'`), set to `'border'` to be the
    same as the element border or a (`number`) for a rectangle with some buffer
    around all text touch borders combined into an encompassing rect (default: `'text'`)

### Examples

```javascript
// Single string
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 't',
    method: 'text',
    options: {
      text: 'hello',
      xAlign: 'center',
      yAlign: 'middle',
    },
  },
);
```

```javascript
// Multi string
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 't',
    method: 'text',
    options: {
      text: [
        {
          text: 'hello',
          font: { style: 'italic', color: [0, 0.5, 1, 1], size: 0.1 },
          xAlign: 'left',
          yAlign: 'bottom',
          location: [-0.35, 0],
        },
        {
          text: 'world',
          location: [0, -0.1],
        },
      ],
      xAlign: 'center',

## OBJ_TextLines

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#text-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Text Lines

![][792]

![][793]

Layout multiple lines of text, justified to the `left`,
`center` or `right`.

Each line is defined by a string in `lines`.

A word or phrase within the line can have custom formatting by defining a
unique ID surrounded in “|” characters. The unique id is then used as a key
in the modifiers object to define the formatting and replacement text. By
default, the unique id will be used as the replacement text.

Each line can have custom formatting or justification by defining a
[OBJ_TextLinesDefinition][617] object instead or a string in the lines
array.

To escape the modifier special character "|", use a forward slash. e.g.

`"This line has a uses the special char: /|"`

### Properties

## Animation

Animations change diagram elements over time.

Each diagram element has its own [AnimationManager][297] (`animations` property) that can coordinate animations for any element.

An animation is a number of [AnimationStep][632]s in either series or parallel. The animation manager provides a way to create these steps, as well as build them into a complete animation.

### <a id="animation-boilerplate"></a> Animation Boilerplate

To test examples within the 'Animation' section of the API reference create an `index.html` file and `index.js` file.

All examples are snippets which can be appended to the end of the `index.js` file.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
    <div id="figureOneContainer" style="width: 800px; height: 800px; background-color: white;">
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/figureone@0.2.3/figureone.min.js'></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='./index.js'></script>
</body>
</html>
```

A grid is included in this javascript file to make it obvious how shapes are animated

```javascript
// index.js
const diagram = new Fig.Diagram({ limits: [-3, -3, 6, 6]});

// grid
diagram.addElements([
  {
    name: 'origin',
    method: 'polygon',
    options: {
      radius: 0.01,
      line: { width: 0.01 },
      sides: 10,
      color: [0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 1]
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'grid',
    method: 'grid',
    options: {
      bounds: [-3, -3, 6, 6],
      yStep: 0.1,
      xStep: 0.1,
      color: [0.7, 0.7, 0.7, 1],
      line: { width: 0.001 },
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'gridMajor',
    method: 'grid',
    options: {
      bounds: [-3, -3, 6, 6],
      yStep: 0.5,
      xStep: 0.5,
      color: [0.8, 0.8, 0.8, 1],
      line: { width: 0.004 }
    },
  },
]);

// shape to animate
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 'p',
    method: 'polygon',
    options: {
      sides: 4,
      fill: true,
      radius: 0.5,
      position: [0, 0],
    },
  },
);
const p = diagram.getElement('p');
diagram.initialize();
```

### Animation Examples

Let's create a simple animation. Start by defining a diagram and retrieving the element to animate by creating the boilerplate files [above][796].

A [PositionAnimationStep][380] can be created to translate the shape, and a [RotationAnimationStep][383] to rotate it

```javascript
const translate = p.animations.position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 });
const rotate = p.animations.rotation({ target: Math.PI, duration: 2 });
```

The animation can then be created and started

```javascript
p.animations.new()
  .then(translate)
  .then(rotate)
  .start();
```

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/animation/ex1.gif"></p>

A more convenient way to chain animation steps in series is to create them inline

```javascript
p.animations.new()
  .position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 })
  .rotation({ target: Math.PI, duration: 2 })
  .start();
```

An animation manager is tied to one element, can be used to animate other elements too

```javascript
// add another element
diagram.addElement({
  name: 'q',
  method: 'polygon',
  options: {
    fill: true, radius: 0.5, sides: 3, position: [-1, 0]
  },
});

const q = diagram.getElement('q');

// Use p animation manager to animate q
p.animations.new()
  .translation({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 })
  .rotation({ element: q, target: Math.PI / 3 * 2, duration: 2})
  .start();
```

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/animation/ex2.gif"></p>

Multiple animations can be added to a single element, but if they modify the same property of the element, then the latter one will overwrite the earlier on each animation frame. In the next example, both animations animate different parts of the element's transform and so will happen in parallel.

```javascript
// animate the translation
p.animations.new()
  .translation({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 })
  .start();

// animate the rotation
p.animations.new()
  .rotation({ target: Math.PI / 2 * 3, duration: 2 })
  .start();
```

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/animation/ex3.gif"></p>

While this is one way to do a parallel animation, a more convenient way (especially when dealing with many steps) is to use a parallel animation step:

```javascript
p.animations.new()
  .inParallel([
    p.animations.translation({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 }),
    p.animations.rotation({ target: Math.PI / 2 * 3, duration: 2 }),
    p.animations.color({ target: [0, 0, 1, 1], delay: 1, duration: 2 }),
  ])
  .start();
```

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/animation/ex4.gif"></p>

Callbacks can be defined when animations finish

```javascript
p.animations.new()
  .delay(1)
  .transform({ target: new Fig.Transform().scale(0.5, 2).rotate(Math.PI).translate(1, 0), duration: 2 })
  .scale({ target: [1, 1], duration: 2 })
  .dissolveOut(1)
  .whenFinished(() => { console.log('animation done') })
  .start();
```

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/animation/ex5.gif"></p>

### Stopping animations

Animations can be stopped from the animation, element and diagram levels.

```javascript
p.animations.new('mover')
  .position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 4})
  .start();

// after 1 second, cancel the specific animation by freezing it in place
setTimeout(() => {
  p.animations.cancel('mover', 'freeze');
}, 1000);
```

```javascript
p.animations.new()
  .position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 4})
  .start();

// after 1 second, cancel all an element's animations by instantly completing them
setTimeout(() => {
  p.stop('complete');
}, 1000);
```

```javascript
p.animations.new()
  .position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 4})
  .start();

// after 1 second, cancel all diagram animations by freezing them
setTimeout(() => {
  diagram.stop('freeze');
}, 1000);
```


## AnimationManager

-   **See: [DiagramElement][14]
    **
-   **See: [AnimationBuilder][342]
    **

Animation Manager

This class manages animations and creates animation steps for use in
animations.

Each [DiagramElement][14] has its own `AnimationManager` in the
`animations` property, though any
animation manager can animate any other element. Therefore all parallel
animations can go through the same manager, or be spread throughout
different element's animation managers. Spread animations out between
elements, or keeping them all in one `AnimationManager` can change how
readable code is, how convenient it is to cancel running animations, and
what order the animations are performed in (`AnimationManager`s tied
to elements drawn earlier will perform their animation steps before those
tied to elements drawn later). `AnimationManager`s will only be processed
on each animation frame if the element they are tied to is not hidden.

The `animations` property within `AnimationManager` is simply an array that
contains a number [AnimationStep][632]s that are executed in parallel.
Typically, these steps would themselves be [SerialAnimationStep][419]s or a
series of animations. This means the animation manager is running a number of
animation series in parallel.

The `AnimationManager`s on [DiagramElement][14]s should be used instead
of instantiating this class separately, as those on `DiagramElements` will
be automatically processed every animation frame.

### Properties

-   `state` **(`"animating"` \| `"idle"` \| `"waitingToStart"`)** 
-   `animations` **[Array][744]&lt;[AnimationStep][797]>** 
-   `subscriptions` **SubscriptionManager** 

### Examples

```javascript
// At its heart the `AnimationManager` is just executing
// an array of animation steps.

// Create animation steps
const position = new Fig.Animation.PositionAnimationStep({
  element: p,
  target: [1, 0],
  duration: 2,
});
const rotation = new Fig.Animation.RotationAnimationStep({
  element: p,
  target: Math.PI,
  duration: 2,
});

// Combine the animations into a SerialAnimationStep
const series = new Fig.Animation.SerialAnimationStep([
  position,
  rotation,
]);

// Add the animations to the animation manager and start
p.animations.animations.push(series);
p.animations.start();
```

```javascript
// Using the `new` method in `AnimationManager` creates a convenient
// `AnimationBuilder` which extends a `SerialAnimationStep` by using
// a fluent API pattern
//
// Create animation steps
const position = new Fig.Animation.PositionAnimationStep({
  element: p,
  target: [1, 0],
  duration: 2,
});
const rotation = new Fig.Animation.RotationAnimationStep({
  element: p,
  target: Math.PI,
  duration: 2,
});

// Build and start the animation
p.animations.new()
  .then(position)
  .then(rotation)
  .start();
```

```javascript
// `AnimationStep`s can also be created from the `AnimationManager`
// with the added convenience that the `DiagramElement` that
// has the `AnimationManager` will be used as the default
// `element` property. This combined with the `AnimationBuilder`
// makes defining most animations clean and readable code

// Build and start the animation
p.animations.new()
  .position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 })
  .rotation({ target: Math.PI, duration: 2 })
  .start();
```

```javascript
// Parallel animations however still need to use explicit animation steps.
// Creating the steps from the `AnimationManager` means the `element` doesn't
// need to be defined.
//
p.animations.new()
  .inParallel([
    p.animations.position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 }),
    p.animations.rotation({ target: Math.PI, duration: 2 })
  ])

## PositionAnimationStep

**Extends ElementAnimationStep**

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#animation-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Position animation step

![][829]

The position animation step animates the first [Translation][171] transform
in the [DiagramElement][14]'s [Transform][207].

By default, the position will start with the element's current position.

Use either `delta` or `target` to define it's end point.

The path of travel between `start` and `target` can either be a straight
line (`'linear'`) or a quadratic bezier curve (`'curve'`)

For custom paths, the [CustomAnimationStep][416] can be used.

### Parameters

-   `options` **[OBJ_PositionAnimationStep][808]** 

### Examples

```javascript
// Using duration
p.animations.new()
  .position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 })
  .start()
```

```javascript
// Using velocity
p.animations.new()
  .position({ target: [1, 0], velocity: 0.5 })
  .start()
```

```javascript
// Linear and curved path
p.animations.new()
  .delay(1)
  .position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 })
  .position({
    target: [0, 0],
    duration: 2,
    path: {
      style: 'curve',
      magnitude: 0.8,
      direction: 'up',
    },
  })
  .start();
```

```javascript
// Different ways to create a stand-alone step
const step1 = p.animations.position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 });
const step2 = new Fig.Animation.PositionAnimationStep({
  element: p,
  target: [0, 0],

  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .start();
```

## RotationAnimationStep

**Extends ElementAnimationStep**

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the

    **

Rotation animation step

![][830]

The rotation animation step animates the first [Rotation][183] transform
in the [DiagramElement][14]'s [Transform][207].

By default, the rotation will start with the element's current rotation.

Use either `delta` or `target` to define it's end point

`clipTo` will clip the element's rotation during animation

### Parameters

-   `options` **[OBJ_RotationAnimationStep][800]** 

### Examples

const step2 = new Fig.Animation.RotationAnimationStep({
  element: p,
  target: 0,
  direction: -1,
  duration: 2,
});

p.animations.new()
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .start();
```

## ScaleAnimationStep

**Extends ElementAnimationStep**

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#animation-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Scale Animation Step

![][831]

The scale animation step animates the first [Scale][77] transform
in the [DiagramElement][14]'s [Transform][207].

By default, the scale will start with the element's current scale.

Use either `delta` or `target` to define it's end point.

Scale can be defined as either a point or number. If number,
both x and y scale terms will be the same.

### Parameters

-   `options` **[OBJ_ScaleAnimationStep][802]** 

### Examples

```javascript
// Using duration
p.animations.new()
  .scale({ target: 2, duration: 2 })
  .start();

  .start();
```

## TransformAnimationStep

**Extends ElementAnimationStep**

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#animation-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Transform Animation Step

![][832]

By default, the transform will start with the element's current transform.

A [Transform][207] chains many transform links where each link might be
a [Rotation][183], [Scale][77] or [Translation][171] transform.

`start`, `target` and `delta` should have the same order of transform links
as the `element`'s transform.

The [TransformAnimationStep][389] will animate each of these links with the
same duration. If `velocity` is used to calculate the duration, then the link
with the longest duration will define the duration of the animation.
`velocity` can either be a transform with the same order of transform links
as the `element` or it can be a constant value, which will be applied to
all transform links. `velocity` cannot be 0.

Use either `delta` or `target` to define it's end point of the animation.

### Parameters

-   `options` **[OBJ_TransformAnimationStep][814]** 

### Examples

```javascript
// Using duration
p.animations.new()
  .transform({
    target: new Fig.Transform().scale(2, 2).rotate(0.5).translate(1, 0),
    duration: 2,
  })

## ScenarioAnimationStep

**Extends ElementAnimationStep**

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#animation-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Scenario Animation Step

![][833]

A scenario defines an element's transform and color and can be used to make
code more readable and reusable.

By default, the scenario will start with the element's current transform and
color.

### Parameters

-   `options` **[OBJ_ScenarioAnimationStep][821]** 

### Examples

```javascript
// NOTE - use these scenario definitions for all examples below
p.scenarios['center'] = { position: [0, 0], scale: [1, 1], color: [1, 0, 0, 1] };
p.scenarios['right'] = { position: [1, 0], scale: [2, 1], color: [0, 0, 1, 1] };
p.scenarios['bottom'] = { position: [0, -0.5], scale: [0.5, 1], color: [0, 0.5, 0, 1] };
```

```javascript
// Using duration
p.animations.new()
  .scenario({ target: 'right', duration: 2 })
  .scenario({ target: 'bottom', duration: 2 })
  .scenario({ target: 'center', duration: 2 })
  .start();
```

```javascript
// Using velocity

```

## ColorAnimationStep

**Extends ElementAnimationStep**

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#animation-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Color animation Step

![][834]

By default, the color will start with the element's current color.

Use either `delta` or `target` to define the end color

In an interactive diagram, it is often useful to highlight elements of the
diagram by coloring them and greying out, or dimming the elements not of
interest. As such, a [DiagramElement][14] has several color attributes:

-   color - current color
-   dimColor - color to dim to
-   defaultColor - color to undim to

The `target` property can accept `'dim'` and `'undim'` as shortcuts to dim
or undim the element.

In addition, the [DimAnimationStep][398] and [UndimAnimationStep][401] can
be used to do the same, which is especially useful when trying to build
easy to read code in a complex animation.

### Parameters

-   `options` **[OBJ_ColorAnimationStep][810]** 

### Examples

```javascript
// Using duration
p.animations.new()
  .color({ target: [0, 0, 1, 1], duration: 1 })
  .color({ target: [0, 0.8, 0, 1], duration: 1 })
  .color({ target: [1, 0, 0, 1], duration: 1 })
  .start();
```

```javascript
// dim and undim an element using dim and undim animation steps
p.animations.new()
  .dim(1)
  .delay(1)
  .undim(1)
  .start();
```

```javascript
// Different ways to create a stand-alone step
const step1 = p.animations.color({
  target: [0, 0, 1, 1],
  duration: 2,
});
const step2 = new Fig.Animation.ColorAnimationStep({
  element: p,
  target: [0, 0.8, 0, 1],

## OpacityAnimationStep

**Extends ElementAnimationStep**

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#animation-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Opacity Animation Step

![][837]

A [DiagramElement][14] has `color` and `opacity` properties. The `color`
property has an alpha channel that defines opacity, but it should be used
as a base color definition, and not used to dissolve an element in and out.

Therefore, to animate an element's opacity or temporarily dissolve in or out
an element, use an opacity animation step.

The `opacity` is multiplied by the
`color` alpha channel to get the final opacity of the element.

By default, the opacity will start with the [DiagramElement][14]'s current
opacity unless dissolving. If dissolving, the opacity will start at `0` if
dissolving in, or `1` if dissolving out unless `dissolveFromCurrent` is
`true` in which case the opacity will start from the current opacity.

The [DissolveInAnimationStep][407] and [DissolveOutAnimationStep][410]
extend the `OpacityAnimationStep` to make it even more convenient to
dissolve.

### Parameters

-   `options` **[OBJ_OpacityAnimationStep][812]** 

### Examples

```javascript
// Using numerical values for opacity
p.animations.new()
  .opacity({ target: 0.4, duration: 2 })
  .opacity({ target: 1, duration: 2 })
  .start();
```

```javascript
// Dissolve out then in
p.animations.new()
  .opacity({ dissolve: 'out', duration: 2 })
  .opacity({ dissolve: 'in', duration: 2 })
  .start();
```

```javascript
// Using the dissolve animation step
p.animations.new()
  .dissolveOut(2)
  .dissolveIn({ delay: 1, duration: 2 })
  .start();
```

```javascript
// Different ways to create a stand-alone step
const step1 = p.animations.opacity({
  target: 0,
  duration: 2,
});
const step2 = new Fig.Animation.OpacityAnimationStep({
  element: p,
  target: 1,
  duration: 2,
});
const step3 = p.animations.dissolveOut({
  duration: 2,
});

## CustomAnimationStep

**Extends AnimationStep**

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#animation-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Custom animation step

![][841]

Custom animation steps are useful for orchestrating complex animations, or
performing non-linear animations.

This step will execute a custom callback function on each animation frame
for the duration of the animation. The callback function will be passed the
percentage progress of the animation.

The percentage progress can either be linear with time, or non-linear.
Built-in non-linear progressions are `'easeinout'`, `'easein`' and
`'easeout'` which will slow progress at the start or end of the animation.
A function to create a custom non-linear progressor can also be used.

### Parameters

-   `options` **[OBJ_CustomAnimationStep][826]** 

### Examples

```javascript
// Move an object through a sine wave of wavelength 1 from
// x = -1 to x = 1
function sine(percentComplete) {
  const x = -1 + percentComplete * 2;
  const y = 0.5 * Math.sin(Math.PI * 2 * x);
  p.setPosition(x, y);
}

p.animations.new()
  .custom({ callback: sine, duration: 5 })
  .start();
```

## SerialAnimationStep

    <a href="#animation-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Execute an array of [AnimationStep][632]s in series.

![][842]

Often the [AnimationBuilder][342] class which extends
`SerialAnimationStep` can be used to create serial animations
in a more clean way.

### Parameters

-   `steps` **([Array][744]&lt;[AnimationStep][797]> | [OBJ_SerialAnimationStep][828])** animation steps to perform in serial

// Using a SerialAnimation step can be cumbersome, but
// can be useful if modularizing animations between files
const Rot = Fig.Animation.RotationAnimationStep;
const Delay = Fig.Animation.DelayAnimationStep;
const Pos = Fig.Animation.PositionAnimationStep;

const series = new Fig.Animation.SerialAnimationStep([
  new Rot({ element: p, target: Math.PI / 2, duration: 2 }),
  new Delay({ duration: 0.2 }),
  new Rot({ element: p, target: Math.PI, duration: 2 }),
  new Delay({ duration: 0.2 }),
  new Rot({ element: p, target: 0, direction: -1, duration: 1.3, progression: 'easein' }),
  new Pos({ element: p, target: [1, 0], duration: 2, progression: 'easeout' }),
]);

p.animations.animations.push(series);
p.animations.start()
```

// Same animation but with `AnimationBuilder` (which is an extension of
// `SerialAnimationStep`)
p.animations.new()
  .rotation({ target: Math.PI / 2, duration: 2 })
  .delay(0.2)
  .rotation({ target: Math.PI, duration: 2 })
  .delay(0.2)
  .rotation({ target: 0, duration: 1, direction: -1, progression: 'easein' })

  .start();
```

## ParallelAnimationStep

**Extends AnimationStep**

-   **See: To test examples, append them to the
    <a href="#animation-boilerplate">boilerplate</a>
    **

Execute an array of `{@link AnimationStep}`s in parallel.

![][843]

The parallel animation step will not complete till all steps are finished.

### Parameters

-   `steps` **([Array][744]&lt;[AnimationStep][797]> | [OBJ_SerialAnimationStep][828])** animation steps to perform in serial

### Examples

```javascript
p.animations.new()
  .inParallel([
    p.animations.position({ target: [1, 0], duration: 2 }),
    p.animations.scale({ target: 2, duration: 2 }),
  ])
  .start();
```

```javascript
// One of the parallel steps is a series of steps
p.animations.new()
  .delay(1)
  .inParallel([
    p.animations.builder()
      .scale({ target: 0.5, duration: 1 })
      .scale({ target: 2, duration: 1 })
      .scale({ target: 1, duration: 2 }),

    p.animations.rotation({ target: Math.PI, duration: 4 }),
  ])
  .start();
```

## Equations

An equation is a set of terms and operators arranged to make some mathematical statement.

Consider the equation:

`a = b + c`

We will call:

-   **terms**: `a`, `b`, `c`
-   **operators**: `=`, `+`

An equation can have different **forms**. One form is above, but it can be rearranged into a different form:

`a - b = c`

If FigureOne, an equation is a [DiagramElementCollection][58] that manages the **terms** and **operators** which are [DiagramElementPrimitive][54]s. To layout the terms and operators into an equation, a form is defined. An equation can define many forms, and animation can be used to change forms.

As the equation and elements are all [DiagramElement][14]s, then they have all the same interactivety and animation abilities as shapes and text.

```javascript
// index.js
const diagram = new Fig.Diagram({ limits: [-3, -3, 6, 6]});
```

### Quick Start

First let's create an equation, with red as the default color:

```javascript
const equation = diagram.create.equation({ color: [1, 0, 0, 1] });
```

Next lets add the definitions for the terms and operators, or the equation elements. The keys of the object are unique identifiers that will be used in the equation forms to order the elements appropriately. The values of the object are the text to display in the equation, or objects that define the text with some formatting.

```javascript
equation.addElements({
  a: 'a',
  b: 'b',
  c: { text: 'c', color: [0, 0, 1, 1] },
  equals: ' = ',
  times: ' \u00D7 ',
});
```

The simplest form defintion is one that lays out the elements in a line. Here the array values are the unique identifiers (the keys) of the `addElements` object:

```javascript
equation.addForms({
  a: ['a', 'equals', 'b', 'times', 'c'],
});
```

Finally, we can add the equation to the diagram and show the form:

```javascript
diagram.elements.add('equation', equation);
equation.showForm('b');
```

### Symbols and Equation Functions

Mathematics has many special symbols that operate on terms, or annotate an equation. These symbols usually have a special layout relative to the terms they operate on.

FigureOne treats symbols like any other equation element, and uses [DiagramElementPrimitive][54]s to draw them. FigureOne then provides a series of functions that can layout terms around these symbols.

Let's take the equation from the last example, and show the form as a fraction.

Start by adding a vinculum symbol to the equation's elements:

```javascript
equation.addElements({
  v: { symbol: 'vinculum'},
});
```

The `equation` is a [DiagramElementCollection][58] with a `eqn` property that contains must of the equation specific information, such as forms and special layout functions, such as `frac`. Let's use this to add the form:

```javascript
const e = equation.eqn.functions;
equation.addForms({
  b: ['b', 'equals', e.frac(['a', 'v', 'c'])],
});
```

Finally, we can display the form:

```javascript
equation.showForm('b');
```

![][845]

Combine all the steps above gives:

```javascript
const equation = diagram.create.equation({ color: [1, 0, 0, 1] });
equation.addElements({
  a: 'a',
  b: 'b',
  c: 'c',
  v: { symbol: 'vinculum'},
  equals: ' = ',
  times: ' \u00D7 ',
});

const e = equation.eqn.functions;
equation.addForms({
  a: ['a', 'equals', 'b', 'times', 'c'],
  b: ['b', 'equals', e.frac(['a', 'v', 'c'])],
});

diagram.elements.add('equation', equation);
equation.showForm('a');
```

### Object Definition

Similar to shapes and text, the same equation above can be defined with an options object. For complicated equations, options objects can be used with code folding in an IDE to more easily read and navigate an equation definition. Also, because object form is JSON compatible, complex equations can be easily shared.

```javascript
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 'equation',
    method: 'equation',
    options: {
      color: [1, 0, 0, 1],
      elements: {
        a: 'a',
        b: 'b',
        c: 'c',
        v: { symbol: 'vinculum'},
        equals: ' = ',
        times: ' \u00D7 ',  // unicode times symbol
      },
      forms: {
        a: ['a', 'equals', 'b', 'times', 'c'],
        b: ['b', 'equals', { frac: ['a', 'vinculum', 'c'] }],
      },
    },
  },
);
const equation = diagram.getElement('equation')
equation.showForm('a');
```

### Equation Animation

Equations can animate between forms. For example, to animate from form `a` to `b` in the equation above:

```javascript
equation.showForm('a');
equation.goToForm({
  form: 'b',
  animate: 'move',
  duration: 2,
});
```

![][846]

The animation can be improved by moving the terms of the equation in curves instead of linearly:

```javascript
equation.addForms({
  bCurved: {
    content: ['b', 'equals', { frac: ['a', 'vinculum', 'c'] }],
    animation: {
      translation: {
        a: { style: 'curve', direction: 'up', mag: 0.8 },
        b: { style: 'curve', direction: 'down', mag: 1.2 },
      },
    },
  },
});

equation.showForm('a');
equation.goToForm({
  form: 'bCurved',
  animate: 'move',
  duration: 2,
  delay: 1,
});
```

## EQN_Annotate

Equation annotation

An annotation is an equation phrase ('annotation') which is laid out relative
to another equation phrase ('content'). For example:

<pre>
                 AAAA
                 AAAA
         CCCCCCCC
         CCCCCCCC
         CCCCCCCC
         CCCCCCCC
</pre>

The options for defining how to annotate one equation phrase with another is
[EQN_Annotation][514]

Content can also be annotated with a glyph (that itself may also be
annotated). The glyph can either encompass the content, or can be to the
top, bottom, left or right of the content

## EQN_Annotation

An annotation's layout is defined by its _position_ and _alignement_.
For instance, an annotation at the top right of the content:

<pre>
                 AAAA
                 AAAA
         CCCCCCCC
         CCCCCCCC
         CCCCCCCC
         CCCCCCCC
</pre>

has a _position_ relative to the content:

-   `xPosition`: `'right'`
-   `yPosition`: `'top'`

and an _alignment_ relative to the annotation:

-   `xAlign`: `'left'`
-   `yAlign`: `'bottom'`

In comparison, if `yAlign` were equal to `'top'`, then it would result in:

<pre>
         CCCCCCCCAAAA
         CCCCCCCCAAAA
         CCCCCCCC
         CCCCCCCC
</pre>

### Properties

-   `content` **[TypeEquationPhrase][858]** 
-   `xPosition` **(`"left"` \| `"center"` \| `"right"` \| [number][752])?** where number is
     the percentage width of the content (`'center'`)
-   `yPosition` **(`"bottom"` \| `"baseline"` \| `"middle"` \| `"top"` \| [number][752])?** where number is the percentage height of the content (`'top'`)
-   `xAlign` **(`"left"` \| `"center"` \| `"right"` \| [number][752])?** where number is
    the percentage width of the annotation (`'center'`)
-   `yAlign` **(`"bottom"` \| `"baseline"` \| `"middle"` \| `"top"` \| [number][752])?** where
    number is the percentage width of the annotation (`'bottom'`)
-   `offset` **[Point][758]?** annotation offset (`[0, 0]`)
-   `scale` **[number][752]?** annotation scale (`1`)
-   `inSize` **[boolean][751]?** (`true`)
-   `fullContentBounds` **[boolean][751]?** (`false`)
-   `reference` **[string][743]?** calling getBounds on a glyph can return a
    suggested position, alignment and offset of an annotation with some name. If
    this name is defined here, then `xPosition`, `yPosition`, `xAlign`, `yAlign`
    and `offset` will be overwritten with the glyph's suggestion.

### Examples

```javascript
annotate: {
   content: 'a',
   annotation: {
     content: 'b',
     xPosition: 'right',
     yPosition: 'top',
     xAlign: 'left',
     yAlign: 'bottom',
     offset: [0, 0],
     scale: 0.5,
     inSize: true,
     fullContentBounds: false,
     // reference: 'root'       // only used when annotating special glyphs
   },
 },
```

## EQN_EncompassGlyph

## Equation Form Types




## TypeEquationPhrase

An equation phrase is used to define an equation form. An equation phrase
can either be the entirety of the form definition, or a series of nested
phrases.

-   An object or array definition (e.g. [EQN_Fraction][460])
-   A string that represents an equation element
-   An array of [TypeEquationPhrase][569]


### Examples

```javascript
:
forms: {
  form1: 'a'
  form2: ['a', 'equals', 'b']
  form3: [{
    frac: {
      numerator: 'a',
      symbol: 'v',
      denominator: '1'
    },
  }, 'equals', 'b'],
  form4: [{ frac: ['a', 'v', '1'], 'equals', 'b'}],
},
```

## TypeFormAlignment

Defines how to align a form

### Properties

-   `fixTo` **([DiagramElementPrimitive][850] \| [DiagramElementCollection][745] \| [Point][758])** 
-   `xAlign` **TypeHAlign** 
-   `yAlign` **TypeVAlign** 

## TypeFormAnimationProperties

Duration and translation options for form animation

### Properties

-   `duration` **[number][752]?** in seconds
-   `translation` **[Object][848]&lt;[TypeFormTranslationProperties][884]>?** 

### Examples

```javascript
// for an equation with two of its elements named 'a' and 'b'
{
  duration: 1,
  translation: {
    a: {
      direction: 'up',
      style: 'curved',
      mag: 0.5,
    },
    b: {
      direction: 'down',
      style: 'curved',
      mag: 0.2,
    },
  },
}
// Note, not all elements need to be defined - only those that need a custom
duration or shouldn't have a linear path
```

## TypeFormTranslationProperties

Form translation properties

### Properties

-   `style` **(`"curved"` \| `"linear"`)** element should move in a straight
    line, or through a curve. Default: `"linear"`
-   `direction` **(`"up"` \| `"down"`)?** curve only - element should move
    through an up or down curve
-   `mag` **[number][752]?** the magnitude of the curve

## TypeEquationFormObject

In mathematics, an equation form is a specific arrangement of an equation's
terms and operators. Different forms will have different arrangements, that
that can be achieved by performing a series of operations to both sides of
the equation.

For instance, the equation:

a + b = c

can be rearranged to a different form:

a = c - b

From the diagram's perspective, a form is a specific layout of equation
elements.

This object defines a how the elements are laid out, what properties the
elements have, and some animation properties for when animating to this form.

In the [Equation][426] object, forms are defined with form names, and
subForm names. Most of the time, the subForm name can be ignored.
However, it is useful when dealing with units. Sometimes you will have a
series of forms you want to animate through, that will be slightly different
depending on the units (for example degrees vs radians). Defining one subForm
as degrees, and a second as radians allows switching between subForms without
complicating the overall equation navigation logic.

See the examples below for how to define subForms.

[Equation#addForms][885].

### Properties

-   `content` **[TypeEquationPhrase][858]** the equation phrase of the form
    defines how the elements are laid out
-   `scale` **[number][752]?** a scaling factor for this form
-   `alignment` **[TypeFormAlignment][854]?** how the Equation's position is aligned with
    this form
-   `subForm` **[string][743]?** subForm name - default: `"base"`
-   `description` **[string][743]?** a description associated with this form -
    used in equation navigator elements (@EquationNavigator)
-   `modifiers` **[object][848]?** string modifiers for the description
-   `fromPrev` **[TypeFormAnimationProperties][857]?** form animation
    properties if animating forward from the previous form in a formSeries
-   `fromNext` **[TypeFormAnimationProperties][857]?** form animation
    properties if animating backward from the next form in a formSeries
-   `duration` **[TypeFormAnimationProperties][857]?** animation move duration
     (fromNext and fromPrev are prioritized over this)
-   `translation` **[TypeFormTranslationProperties][884]?** animation move
    style (fromNext and fromPrev are prioritized over this)
-   `elementMods` **[object][848]?** properties to set in the equation element
    (@DiagramElementPrimitive) when this form is shown
-   `animation` **{duration: [number][752]??, translation: [TypeFormTranslationProperties][884]?}?** 

### Examples

```javascript
// Simple form definition of two different forms of the same equation and one
// of the elements is colored blue in one form and red in the other
forms: {
  form1: {
    content: ['a', 'plus', 'b', 'equals', 'c'],
    elementMods: {
      'a': { color: [0, 0, 1, 1] },
    }
  },
  form2: {
    content: ['a', 'equals', 'c', 'minus', 'b'],
    elementMods: {
      'a': { color: [1, 0, 0, 1] },
    }
  },
}
```

```javascript
// Example using subForms all defined at once
forms: {
  form1: {
    deg: ['a', 'deg'],
    rad: ['a', 'rad'],
  },
}
```

```javascript
// Example using subForms all defined separately

## TypeEquationForm

A single form definition can either be:

-   an equation phrase [TypeEquationPhrase][569]
-   or an equation form object [TypeEquationFormObject][578]
-   or an object of subforms:

     {
        subform1: ([TypeEquationPhrase][569] \| [TypeEquationFormObject][578]),
        subform2: ...
     },


## TypeEquationForms

An object of equation forms where each key is the form name and each value
is a form defintion [TypeEquationForm][581]


## TypeFormRestart

When an equation form series is restarted, or cycled back to the first form
in the series, then two special animations can be defined with this object:

-   `moveFrom`: the equation will move from a location (usually another equation of the same form)
-   `pulse`: An element will be pulsed when the animation is finished.

The default values in the pulse object are are:

-   `duration`: 1s
-   `scale`: 1.1

### Properties

-   `formRestart` **{moveFrom: ([Point][758]? | [DiagramElementCollection][745])?, pulse: {duration: [number][752]?, scale: [number][752]?, element: [DiagramElement][750]??}?}?** 

## Equation Option Types




## TypeEquationGoToFormOptions

Options object for [Equation#goToForm][888].

Often, `goToForm` is called to animate from a shown form to a desired form.
Therefore there will be some equation elements that:

-   Are currently shown, but need to be hidden as they are not in the desired form
-   Are currently shown, are in the desired form, and need to be moved to the
    correct layout position for the desired form
-   Are currently hidden and need to be shown in the desired form

The order that elements are shown, hidden and moved is defined by the
`animate` property:

-   `'move'`: Dissolve out elements to hide, move existing elements to new,
    dissolve in elements that need to be shown
-   `'dissolveInThenMove'`: Dissolve out the elements to hide, dissolve in the
    elements that need to be shown in the correct locations of the form, then
    move existing elements to their correct locations
-   `'dissolve'`: Dissolve out the entire current form, and then dissolve in the entire new form
-   `'moveFrom'`: Shows the desired form at the position defined in the
    formRestart property of [EQN_Equation][453], then moves it to the
    current location
-   `'pulse'`: Same as `'dissolve'`, but once finished will pulse the element
    defined in the pulse object in the formRestart property of [EQN_Equation][453]

If a form is already animating, then the `ifAnimating` property will define
the behavior of the animation:

-   `cancelGoTo: true`, `skipToTarget: true`: Current animation will skip to
    the end, and current goTo call will be cancelled
-   `cancelGoTo: true`, `skipToTarget: false`: Current animation will stop in
    its current state, and current goTo call will be cancelled
-   `cancelGoTo: false`, `skipToTarget: true`: Current animation will skip to
    the end, and current goTo call will then be executed
-   `cancelGoTo: false`, `skipToTarget: false`: Current animation will stop in
    its current state, and current goTo call will be executed

### Properties

## OBJ_Texture

Texture definition object

A texture file is an image file like a jpg, or png.

Textures can be used instead of colors to fill a shape in WebGL.

Textures are effectively overlaid on a shape. Therefore, to overlay the
texture with the correct offset, magnification and aspect ratio the texture
must be mapped to the space the shape's vertices are defined in
(vertex space).

This is done by defining a window, or rectangle, for the texture file
(`mapFrom`) and a similar window in vertex space (`mapTo`).
The texture is then offset and scaled such that its window aligns with the
vertex space window.

The texture file has coordinates of (0, 0) in the bottom left corner and
(1, 1) in the top right corner.

Therefore, to make a 1000 x 500 image fill a 2 x 1 rectangle in vertex space
centered at (0, 0) you would define:

    mapFrom: new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)
    mapTo: new Rect(-1, -0.5, 2, 1)

If instead you wanted to zoom the image in the same rectange by a factor of 2
you could either:

    mapFrom: new Rect(0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5)
    mapTo: new Rect(-1, -0.5, 2, 1)

or

    mapFrom: new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)
    mapTo: new Rect(-2, -1, 4, 2)

Two ways of doing this are provided as sometimes it is more convenient to
think about the window on the image, and other times the window in vertex
space.

If the shape has fill outside the texture boundaries then either the
texture can be repeated, or a pixel from the border (edge) of the image is
used (called clamping to edge).
WebGL only allows images that are square with a side length that is a
power of 2 (such as 16, 32, 64, 128 etc) to be repeated. All other images
can only be clamped to their edge.

To repeat all other image resolutions, a texture can be mapped to a rectangle
and then the rectangle repeated throughout the diagram.

### Properties

-   `src` **[string][743]** The url or location of the image
-   `mapTo` **[Rect][749]?** vertex space window (`new Rect(-1, -1, 2, 2)`)

## OBJ_QuadraticBezier

Curved translation path options, that defineds the control
point of a quadratic bezier curve.

Use `controlPoint` to define the control point directly. This
will override all other properties.

Otherwise `direction`, `magnitude` and `offset` can be used
to calculate the control point based on the start and end
points of the curve.

The control point is calculated by:

-   Define a line from start to target - it will have length `d`
-   Define a point `P` on the line
-   Define a control line from point `P` with length `d` and some
    angle delta from the original line.

The properties then customize this calculation:

-   `magnitude` will scale the distance d
-   `offset` will define where on the line point `P` is where `0.5` is
    the midpoint and `0.1` is 10% along the line from the start location
-   `direction` will define which side of the line the control line should be
    drawn
-   `angle` defines the angle delta between the line and the control line - by
     default this a right angle (Math.PI / 2)

The directions `'up'`, `'down'`, `'left'`, `'right'` all reference the side
of the line. The `'positive'`
direction is the side of the line that the line would move toward when
rotated in the positive direction around the start point. The
'`negative`' side of the line is then the opposite side.

These directions only work when the `angle` is between `0` and `Math.PI`.

### Properties

-   `controlPoint` **([TypeParsablePoint][757] | null)** 
-   `magnitude` **[number][752]** 
-   `offset` **[number][752]** 
-   `angle` **[number][752]** (`Math.PI / 2`)

## CPY_Step

![][901]

Copy Step options object

A copy step defines how to copy existing points.

An array of copy steps will cumulatively copy points from an original set of
points.

So, if there are two copy steps then:

-   the first step will copy the original points
-   the second step will copy the original points and the first copy of the
    points

For example, a grid of a shape can be made with two copy steps. The first
replicates the shape along the x axis, creating a line of shapes. The second
copy step then replicates the line of shapes in the y axis, creating a grid
of shapes.

Each copy step appends its copied points onto an array of points that
started with the original points. By default, copy steps operate on all
points created in previous steps. However, the properties `start` and `end`
can be used to make the current step only operate on a subset of the points.

`start` and `end` refer to the indexes of the copy steps where the original
points is at index 0, and the first copy step is at index 1. Copy step
arrays can also include _marker strings_ which make defining `start` and
`end` more convient (see the third example below). These marker strings
can be used as `start` and `end` values. Marker strings are included
in the copy step indexing.

There are two main ways to make a copy, either copy the points `to` a
location, or copy the points `along` a path.

When using the `to` property, if a [Point][71] is defined
then the points will be copied to that point. If a [Transform][207] is
defined, then a copy of the points will be transformed by that transform. An
array of points and transforms can be defined to make multiple copies of the
points.

When using the `along` property, the points are copied a number (`num`) of
times along a path with some `step`. The paths can be horiztonal (`'x'`),
vertical (`'y'`), at an angle (`number`) or through a `'rotation'` around
a `center` point.

When copying along a line (`along` is `'x'`, `y'` or a `number`), then
`step` will be the distance offset along the line.

When copying along a rotation (`along` is `'rotation'`), then `step` will be
the angular step in radians.

Any step can use the `original` property - but it will only operate on the
last step that uses it. When `original` is `false`, then all points before
that copy step will not be included in the returned Point array.

### Properties

-   `to` **([TypeParsablePoint][757] \| [TypeParsableTransform][789] \| [Array][744]&lt;([TypeParsablePoint][757] \| [TypeParsableTransform][789])>)?** copy points to
    a location or locations or transform a copy of the points
-   `along` **(`"x"` \| `"y"` \| [number][752] \| `"rotation"` \| `"moveOnly"`)?** copy points
    along a linear path where `number` is a path at an angle in radians
-   `num` **[number][752]?** the number of copies to make when copying `along` a
    path
-   `step` **[number][752]?** distance between copies if `along` is `'x'` or
    `'y'` or a `number`, delta angle between copies if `along` is `'rotation'`
-   `center` **[TypeParsablePoint][757]?** the center point about which to rotate
    the copies when using `along` = `'rotation'`
-   `start` **([number][752] \| [string][743])?** copy step index or marker defining the
    start of the points to copy
-   `end` **([number][752] \| [string][743])?** copy step index or marker defining the end
    of the points to copy
-   `original` **[boolean][751]?** `false` excludes all points before this step
    in the final result (`true`)

    ],
  },
});
```

## TypeWhen

`'nextFrame'` \| `'prevFrame'` \| `'syncNow'` \| `'now'`

`'syncNow'` is a synchronized 'now' time. The
first time 'syncNow' is used, the current time will be stored and used
for all subsequent calls to 'syncNow'. 'syncNow' is reset every
time a new animation frame is drawn, or 100ms after a first syncNow call
has been made after a reset.

'now' is the instantaneous time

`'nextFrame'` will be the time of the next animation frame

`'prevFrame'` is the time of the last animation frame

diagram.addElement({
  name: 'a',
  method: 'shapes.polyline',
  options: {
    points: [[0, 0], [1, 0]],
    width: 0.02,
    arrow: {
      scale: 1.2,
      start: 'bar',
      end: {
        head: 'polygon',
        sides: 6,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## OBJ_Arrows

Line end's arrow definition options object.

`start` and `end` define the properties of the arrows at the start and
end of the line. Instead of defining [OBJ_Arrow][697] objects for the
start and end, a string that is the arrow's `head` property can also be
used and the size dimensions will be the default.

All other properties will be used as the default for the `start` and
`end` objects.

If any of the default properties are defined, then the line will have
both a start and end arrow.

If only one end of the line is to have an arrow, then define only the
`start` or `end` properties and no others.

### Properties

-   `start` **([OBJ_Arrow][775] \| [ArrowHead][776])?** arrow at start of line
-   `end` **([OBJ_Arrow][775] \| [ArrowHead][776])?** arrow at end of line

-   `transform` **[TypeParsableTransform][789]** 
-   `color` **[Array][744]&lt;[number][752]>** 
-   `isShown` **[boolean][751]** 

## OBJ_Pulse

Pulse options object

An element can have its scale pulsed of some `duration` with some
`frequency`.

If the scale is pulsed from the center of an object, the object will simply
grow larger then smaller. If however, the scale is pulse from the side of the
object, then the object will grow larger while moving away from the pulse
center. Therefore the center of the scale pulse is defined with `centerOn`,
`xAlign` and `yAlign`.

How the pulse transitions from a scale of 1 to the pulse scale (s) is defined
by the `progression`. A triangle progression will linearly progress from 1
to s and back to 1 over time. Alternately `sinusoid` slows the progression
at the minimums and maximums of the pulse.

### Properties

-   `xAlign` **(`"left"` \| `"center"` \| `"right"` \| `"origin"` \| [number][752])?** horiontal alignment with pulse center
-   `yAlign` **(`"bottom"` \| `"middle"` \| `"top"` \| `"origin"` \| [number][752])?** vertical
    alignment with pulse center
-   `centerOn` **(null | [DiagramElement][750] \| [TypeParsablePoint][757])?** center
    of pulse
-   `space` **(`"diagram"` \| `"gl"` \| `"local"` \| `"vertex"`)?** space the
    `centerOn` property operates when `centerOn` is a `TypeParsablePoint`
-   `frequency` **[number][752]?** pulse frequency in Hz
-   `duration` **[number][752]?** pulse duration in seconds
-   `scale` **[number][752]?** pulse scale
-   `progression` **(`"sinusoid"` \| `"triangle"`)?** function that defines
    how the scale should progress over time (`sinusoid`)
-   `x` **(`"left"` \| `"center"` \| `"right"` \| `"origin"` \| [number][752])?** 
-   `y` **(`"bottom"` \| `"middle"` \| `"top"` \| `"origin"` \| [number][752])?**

## Scenarios

All scenarios set to element.

Scenarios are preset transforms, color and visibility settings that can be
easily animated to.

This is an object where the keys are scenario names and values are
[OBJ_Scenario][710] objects defining the scenario.

### Properties

-   `scenarioName` **[OBJ_Scenario][895]** where scenarioName can be any
    string that names the scenario

## ElementMovementState

Element movement state

### Properties

-   `previousTime` **[number][752]?** 
-   `previousTransform` **[Transform][747]** 
-   `velocity` **[Transform][747]** 

## ElementPulseState

Element pulse state

### Properties

-   `startTime` **[number][752]?** 

## ElementState

Element state

### Properties

-   `isBeingMoved` **[boolean][751]** 
-   `isMovingFreely` **[boolean][751]** 
-   `movement` **[ElementMovementState][911]** 
-   `isPulsing` **[boolean][751]** 
-   `pulse` **[ElementPulseState][912]** 
-   `preparingToStop` **[boolean][751]** 

## DrawingObject

-   **See: [DiagramElementPrimitive][54]
    **

Drawing Object

Manages drawing an element to a WebGL or Context 2D canvas. Can also
be used to manage a HTML element on the screen.

### Properties

-   `border` **[Array][744]&lt;[Array][744]&lt;[Point][758]>>** each array of points defines a
    closed boundary or border of the element. An element may have multiple
    closed borders. A border defines where a shape can be touched, or how it
    bounces of diagram boundaries
-   `holeBorder` **[Array][744]&lt;[Array][744]&lt;[Point][758]>>** areas where a shape cannot be
    touched

## TypeEquationTextElement

Definition of a text or symbol equation element. Symbol properties take
receive priority over text properties, so if 'symbol' is defined, then 'text'
will be ignored.


### Properties

-   `text` **[string][743]?** Text element only
-   `font` **DiagramFont?** Text element only
-   `style` **(`"italic"` \| `"normal"`)?** Text element only
-   `symbol` **[string][743]?** Symbol element only
-   `side` **(`"top"` \| `"left"` \| `"bottom"` \| `"right"`)?** Symbol element only
-   `mods` **[object][848]?** Properties to set on instantiated element
-   `color` **[Array][744]&lt;[number][752]>?** Color to set the element

## container

Equation container function

### Parameters

-   `optionsOrArray` **[EQN_Container][877]** 

### Examples

```javascript
e = new Equation();
e.addElements({
  v: { symbol: 'vinculum' },
});
frac = e.eqn.functions.frac;
eqn.addForms({
  base: ['a', 'equals', frac(['b', 'v', 'c'])],
});
```

## frac

Equation fraction function

### Parameters

-   `optionsOrArray` **[EQN_Fraction][865]** 

### Examples

```javascript
e = new Equation();
e.addElements({
  v: { symbol: 'vinculum' },
});
frac = e.eqn.functions.frac;
eqn.addForms({
  base: ['a', 'equals', frac(['b', 'v', 'c'])],
});
```

## AnimationProgression

Animation progression function.

As the animation time progresses, a percentage of the total animation
duration will be passed to this function.

This function then calculates and returns the percent progress of the
animation.

This function can be used to make non-linear progressions of an animation.
For instance, it could be used to create a progression that is slowed
at the start or end of the animation.

Type: function ([number][752]): [number][752]

### Parameters

-   `percent` **[number][752]** percentage of duration

Returns **[number][752]** percent of animation complete

## AnimationStartTime

Animation start time options.

[TypeWhen][695] | number | null

When multiple animations need to be started, it is often
desirable to synchronise their start times.

`'nextFrame'` will start the animation on the
next animation frame. Starting several animations with `nextFrame`
will ensure they are all synchronized to that frame time.

Similarly `'prevFrame'` starts the animation on the last animation
frame.

`'syncNow'` will start an animation at a synchronized 'now' time. The
first time 'syncNow' is used, the current time will be stored and used
for all subsequent calls to 'syncNow'. 'syncNow' is reset every
time a new animation frame is drawn.

Alternately, `'now'` can be used which will use the current time as
the animation start time. As javascript is single threaded, using `'now`
on multiple animations will result in them all having slightly different
start times.

A custom time can be used if a `number` is defined.

`null` will result in `'nextFrame'` being used
