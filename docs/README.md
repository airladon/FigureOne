## Introduction

This introduction will introduce some key terms and concepts that are found frequently throughout the documentation.

#### Diagrams, Primitives and Collections

**FigureOne** allows you to create a _figure_, or _diagram_ that can be both interactive and animated.

A diagram has one or more _diagram elements_. A diagram element is a simple shape, some text, or it may be a collection of other elements. These elements combine to create a complex drawing, graph or equation.

In the language of **FigureOne**, there are two types of [DiagramElements][446]:

-   [DiagramElementPrimitive][54] - an element that will draw something to the screen, such as a line, shape or text
-   [DiagramElementCollection][58] - collections of primitives or other collections

Each [DiagramElement][14] has a [Transform][318] that may contain one or more translations, rotations and scaling factors. When the element is rendered to the screen, the transform will be applied. In the case of a [DiagramElementPrimitive][54], the shape or text will be transformed. In the case of a [DiagramElementCollection][58], all the diagram elements it contains will have the transform applied to them.

This means there is a heierachy of [DiagramElement][14] objects, where the parent transform is applied to (cascaded with) the child transform. Therefore collections can be thought of as modular building blocks of a more complex figure.

Changing an element's transform moves the element through space. Changing the element's transform over time animates the element.

#### An Example

Let's say we want to create a rotating labeled line. As the line is rotated, the label follows the line.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/ex1.png"></p>

To create this diagram, we might use a diagram element hierarchy like:

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/ex1-hierarchy.png"></p>

The drawn elements, the line and text, are primitives. They are created in the simple no rotation case. If the line is 0.8 long, and it starts at (0, 0), then the text might be at (0.4, 0.1)

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/ex1-collection.png"></p>

The diagram itself has limits that define the coordinate window that can be shown, in this case its bottom left is the origin, and it is 3 wide and 2 high. We want the collection to be rotated, with the center of rotation at the center of the diagram. Therefore we apply a rotation and translation transform to the collection.

<p style="text-align: center"><img src="./tutorials/ex1-diagram.png"></p>

There are several different ways to create the same diagram, but this way is used as it highlights how a collection can be used to transform a group of primitive elements.

#### Coordinate spaces

FigureOne renders shapes in WebGL, text in Context2D and can even manipulate html elements as diagram elements. As WebGL is used most in FigureOne, it will be used as an example to introduce coorindate spaces and why they matter.

WebGL is rendered in a html [canvas][447] element.

The [canvas][447] element is defined in screen pixels. The WebGL view re-maps the canvas pixels to -1 to +1 coordinates in both the vertical and horizontal directions, independent on the aspect ratio of the canvas.

When the canvas aspect ratio is not a square, or it is more convenient to create a diagram in a coordinate space not mapped between -1 to +1, then it is useful to have a separate _diagram space_. In the example above, the diagram space re-maps the _GL space_ to 0 to 3 in the horizontal and 0 to 2 in the vertical.

These are three examples of different coordinate spaces - _pixel space_, _GL space_ and _diagram space_.

If you want to move or modify an element, you need to think about what you want to modify it _relative_ to. Do you want to move it relative to other elements in the diagram? In other words, do you want to move it in _diagram space_? Or do you want to move it relative to other elements within the parent, or local collection - _local space_. Alternately, you might want to modify the vertices of the shape, in _vertex space_.

In simple diagrams, where no collections are used, or collections don't transform their child elements you don't really need to think about what space you are working in. Diagram space will be the same as local space and vertex space. You won't care about the higher level GL or pixel spaces.

But if you have transformed collections, or if you are tying an element to a location on the screen you will need to convert points between the different spaces. In addition, it is useful to know about these different spaces as sometimes they are referred to in the documentation.

One way to think about what space you are modifying is:

-   Elements that are direct children of the diagram: element transforms are in diagram space
-   Elements that are direct children of a collection: element transforms are in local space (the space of the parent colleciton)
-   Vertex definitions in element primitives: vertex space

For example, a square might be defined in vertex space as a square with length 1, centered around the origin.

The transform of the diagram element primitive that controls the square will move the square in _local space_ - the space relative to all other elements that are the children of the same parent collection.

If the parent collection's parent is the diagram itself, then its transform will move the colleciton in diagram space.

Converting between spaces is relatively straight forward. All diagram elements have methods to find their position or bounds in _diagram_, _local_ or _vertex_ space. The diagram has transforms that allow conversion between _diagram_, _GL_ and _pixel_ spaces.

Where this is useful is if two primitives have different parents, and you want to move one to be in the same position as the other. To do this you would convert the target element position to _diagram space_, and then to the _local space_ of the element to move.

#### Drawing

When it is time to draw the scene, the diagram will pass an initial transform to the first element in the hierarchy. In the example above, the "Labeled Line" collection. This transform will include any translations and scaling needed to convert from _diagram_ space to _GL_ space for actual rendering.

The "Labeled Line" collection will then cascade this transform with it's own rotation and translation transform, and pass this to its children, the "Label" and "Line" primitives.

The "Label" primitive has it's own transform that translates it to the middle of the horizontal line in _local_ space. The transform will be combined with the one from its parent, creating a final transform to draw the label with.

The primitive's shape or text definition never needs to change. At draw time, it is simply transformed by it's own transform and all the ancestors directly above it in the hierarchy. This is the same method used by WebGL as it reduces the amount of memory that needs to be loaded into the graphics memory each draw frame. All the vertices of a shape are loaded into the graphics memory just once, and each frame just a transform is passed informs the graphics processor how to orient the vertices.

If you have a dynamic shape whose vertices do change every frame (like a morphing animation), you can choose to load the vertices every frame. However, depending on the performance of the browser's host machine, and the number of vertices being adjusted, you might see a performance impact compared to a shape with a similar amount of vertices that do not change.

#### Code

Finally, let's see the code for the example above. Two files, `index.html` and `index.js` should be in the same folder.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!doctype html>
<html>
<body>
    <div id="figureOneContainer" style="width: 1200px; height: 800px; background-color: white;">
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/figureone@0.2.3/figureone.min.js'></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src='./index.js'></script>
</body>
</html>
```

```javascript
// index.js
const diagram = new Fig.Diagram({ limits: [0, 0, 6, 4 ]});
diagram.addElement(
  {
    name: 'labeledLine',
    method: 'collection',
    addElements: [
      {
        name: 'line',
        method: 'line',
        options: {
          p1: [0, 0],
          p2: [2, 0],
          width: 0.01,
          color: [0, 0, 1, 1],
        },
      },
      {
        name: 'label',
        method: 'text',
        options: {
          text: 'Line 1',
          position: [1, 0.1],
          font: { color: [0, 0, 1, 1] },
          xAlign: 'center',
        },
      },
    ],
    options: {
      position: [3, 2],
    },
    mods: {
      isTouchable: true,
      isMovable: true,
      touchInBoundingRect: true,
      move: {
        type: 'rotation',
      },
    },
  },
);
diagram.elements.isTouchable = true;
diagram.initialize();
```

#### Using FigureOne

The example above shows how a figure can be defined with simple javascript objects, able to be encoded simply in JSON. This means complex figures or modules can be shared and reused easily.

For many uses, it is fine to fully define a diagram and all its elements before a user interacts with it.

Diagrams can also be defined more dynamically, such as in the example below which has exactly the same function as the example above.

```javascript
// index.js
const diagram = new Fig.Diagram({ limits: [0, 0, 6, 4 ]});
diagram.initialize();

const label = diagram.create.text({
  text: 'Line 1',
  position: [1, 0.1],
  font: { color: [0, 0, 1, 1] },
  xAlign: 'center',
});
const line = diagram.create.line({
  p1: [0, 0],
  p2: [2, 0],
  width: 0.01,
  color: [0, 0, 1, 1],
});
const labeledLine = diagram.create.collection({});
diagram.elements.add('labeledLine', labeledLine);
labeledLine.add('line', line);
labeledLine.add('label', label);
labeledLine.setPosition(3, 2);
labeledLine.move.type = 'rotation';
labeledLine.touchInBoundingRect = true;
labeledLine.setMovable();
```


## Diagram




## Diagram

Class to create a diagram.

By default, a diagram will attach a WebGL canvas and Context2D
canvas to the html `div` element with id`"figureOneContainer"`.

To attach to a different `div`, use the `htmlId` property in the class
constructor.

The diagram manages all drawing elements, rendering the drawing elements
on browser animation frames and listens for guestures from the user.

The diagram also has a recorder, allowing to record and playback states,
and gestures.

If a diagram is paused, then all drawing element animations will
also be paused.

It also has a number of convenience functions for create drawing elements
already attached to the drawing canvases, and useful transforms for
converting between the different spaces (e.g. pixel, GL, diagram).

## Diagram Elements




## DiagramElement

Diagram Element base class

The set of properties and methods shared by all diagram elements

A diagram element has several color related properties. Color is
defined as an RGBA array with values between 0 and 1. The alpha
channel defines the transparency or opacity of the color where
1 is fully opaque and 0 is fully transparent.

The `color` property stores the element's current color, while the
`defaultColor` property stores the element's color when not dimmed or
dissolving. Color should only be set using the `setColor` method.

An element can be "dimmed" or "undimmed". For instance,
a red element might turn a less obvious grey when dimmed. The property
`dimColor` stores the desired color to dim to and should be set with
`setDimColor()`

An element can be dissolved in or out with animation. Dissolving
an element out transitions its opacity from its current value to 0.
The `opacity` property is used when dissolving. The opacity is multiplied by
the alpha channel of `color` to net a final opacity. Opacity should not be
set directly as it will be overwritten by dissolve animations.

### Parameters

-   `transform` **[Transform][454]**  (optional, default `new Transform()`)

## EQN_Annotate

Equation annotation

An annotation is an equation phrase ('annotation') which is laid out relative
to another equation phrase ('content'). For example:

<pre>
                 AAAA
                 AAAA
         CCCCCCCC
         CCCCCCCC
         CCCCCCCC
         CCCCCCCC
</pre>

The options for defining how to annotate one equation phrase with another is
[EQN_Annotation][130]

Content can also be annotated with a glyph (that itself may also be
annotated). The glyph can either encompass the content, or can be to the
top, bottom, left or right of the content

<pre>
                        Top Glyph

has a _position_ relative to the content:

-   `xPosition`: `'right'`
-   `yPosition`: `'top'`

and an _alignment_ relative to the annotation:

-   `xAlign`: `'left'`
-   `yAlign`: `'bottom'`

In comparison, if `yAlign` were equal to `'top'`, then it would result in:

### Properties

-   `content` **[TypeEquationPhrase][471]** 
-   `xPosition` **(`"left"` \| `"center"` \| `"right"` \| [number][459])?** where number is
     the percentage width of the content (`'center'`)
-   `yPosition` **(`"bottom"` \| `"baseline"` \| `"middle"` \| `"top"` \| [number][459])?** where number is the percentage height of the content (`'top'`)
-   `xAlign` **(`"left"` \| `"center"` \| `"right"` \| [number][459])?** where number is
    the percentage width of the annotation (`'center'`)
-   `yAlign` **(`"bottom"` \| `"baseline"` \| `"middle"` \| `"top"` \| [number][459])?** where
    number is the percentage width of the annotation (`'bottom'`)
-   `offset` **[Point][465]?** annotation offset (`[0, 0]`)
-   `scale` **[number][459]?** annotation scale (`1`)
-   `inSize` **[boolean][458]?** (`true`)
-   `fullContentBounds` **[boolean][458]?** (`false`)
-   `reference` **[string][450]?** calling getBounds on a glyph can return a
    suggested position, alignment and offset of an annotation with some name. If
    this name is defined here, then `xPosition`, `yPosition`, `xAlign`, `yAlign`
    and `offset` will be overwritten with the glyph's suggestion.

### Examples

```javascript
annotate: {
   content: 'a',
   annotation: {
     content: 'b',
     xPosition: 'right',
     yPosition: 'top',
     xAlign: 'left',
     yAlign: 'bottom',
     offset: [0, 0],
     scale: 0.5,
     inSize: true,
     fullContentBounds: false,
     // reference: 'root'       // only used when annotating special glyphs
   },
 },
```

## Equation Form Types




## TypeEquationPhrase

An equation phrase is used to define an equation form. An equation phrase
can either be the entirety of the form definition, or a series of nested
phrases.

-   An object or array definition (e.g. [EQN_Fraction][76])
-   A string that represents an equation element
-   An array of [TypeEquationPhrase][185]


### Examples

```javascript
:
forms: {
  form1: 'a'
  form2: ['a', 'equals', 'b']
  form3: [{
    frac: {
      numerator: 'a',
      symbol: 'v',
      denominator: '1'
    },
  }, 'equals', 'b'],
  form4: [{ frac: ['a', 'v', '1'], 'equals', 'b'}],
},
```

## TypeFormAlignment

Defines how to align a form

### Properties

-   `fixTo` **([DiagramElementPrimitive][496] \| [DiagramElementCollection][452] \| [Point][465])** 
-   `xAlign` **TypeHAlign** 
-   `yAlign` **TypeVAlign** 

## TypeFormAnimationProperties

Duration and translation options for form animation

### Properties

-   `duration` **[number][459]?** in seconds
-   `translation` **[Object][498]&lt;[TypeFormTranslationProperties][499]>?** 

### Examples

```javascript
// for an equation with two of its elements named 'a' and 'b'
{
  duration: 1,
  translation: {
    a: {
      direction: 'up',
      style: 'curved',
      mag: 0.5,
    },
    b: {
      direction: 'down',
      style: 'curved',
      mag: 0.2,
    },
  },
}
// Note, not all elements need to be defined - only those that need a custom
duration or shouldn't have a linear path
```

## TypeFormTranslationProperties

Form translation properties

### Properties

-   `style` **(`"curved"` \| `"linear"`)** element should move in a straight
    line, or through a curve. Default: `"linear"`
-   `direction` **(`"up"` \| `"down"`)?** curve only - element should move
    through an up or down curve
-   `mag` **[number][459]?** the magnitude of the curve

## TypeEquationFormObject

In mathematics, an equation form is a specific arrangement of an equation's
terms and operators. Different forms will have different arrangements, that
that can be achieved by performing a series of operations to both sides of
the equation.

For instance, the equation:

a + b = c

can be rearranged to a different form:

a = c - b

From the diagram's perspective, a form is a specific layout of equation
elements.

This object defines a how the elements are laid out, what properties the
elements have, and some animation properties for when animating to this form.

In the [Equation][207] object, forms are defined with form names, and
subForm names. Most of the time, the subForm name can be ignored.
However, it is useful when dealing with units. Sometimes you will have a
series of forms you want to animate through, that will be slightly different
depending on the units (for example degrees vs radians). Defining one subForm
as degrees, and a second as radians allows switching between subForms without
complicating the overall equation navigation logic.

See the examples below for how to define subForms.

[Equation#addForms][500].

### Properties

-   `content` **[TypeEquationPhrase][471]** the equation phrase of the form
    defines how the elements are laid out
-   `scale` **[number][459]?** a scaling factor for this form
-   `alignment` **[TypeFormAlignment][501]?** how the Equation's position is aligned with
    this form
-   `subForm` **[string][450]?** subForm name - default: `"base"`
-   `description` **[string][450]?** a description associated with this form -
    used in equation navigator elements (@EquationNavigator)
-   `modifiers` **[object][498]?** string modifiers for the description
-   `fromPrev` **[TypeFormAnimationProperties][502]?** form animation
    properties if animating forward from the previous form in a formSeries
-   `fromNext` **[TypeFormAnimationProperties][502]?** form animation
    properties if animating backward from the next form in a formSeries
-   `duration` **[TypeFormAnimationProperties][502]?** animation move duration
     (fromNext and fromPrev are prioritized over this)
-   `translation` **[TypeFormTranslationProperties][499]?** animation move
    style (fromNext and fromPrev are prioritized over this)
-   `elementMods` **[object][498]?** properties to set in the equation element
    (@DiagramElementPrimitive) when this form is shown
-   `animation` **{duration: [number][459]??, translation: [TypeFormTranslationProperties][499]?}?** 

### Examples

```javascript
// Simple form definition of two different forms of the same equation and one
// of the elements is colored blue in one form and red in the other
forms: {
  form1: {
    content: ['a', 'plus', 'b', 'equals', 'c'],
    elementMods: {
      'a': { color: [0, 0, 1, 1] },
    }
  },
  form2: {
    content: ['a', 'equals', 'c', 'minus', 'b'],
    elementMods: {
      'a': { color: [1, 0, 0, 1] },
    }
  },
}
```

```javascript
// Example using subForms all defined at once
forms: {
  form1: {
    deg: ['a', 'deg'],
    rad: ['a', 'rad'],
  },
}
```

```javascript
// Example using subForms all defined separately
const eqn = new Equation();
eqn.addForms({
  deg: {
    content: ['a', 'deg'],
    subForm:'deg',
  }
});
eqn.addForms({
  rad: {
    content: ['a', 'rad'],
    subForm:'rad',
  }
});
```

```javascript
// Example showing all form options
forms: {
  form1: {
    content: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    subForm: 'deg',
    scale: 1.2,
    alignment: {
      fixTo: 'b',
      xAlign: 'center',
      yAlign: 'bottom',
    },
    description: '|Form| 1 |description|',
    modifiers: {
      Form: html.highlight([1, 0, 0, 0]),
    },
    elementMods: {
      a: {
        color: color1,
        isTouchable: true,
      },
    },
    duration: 1,
    translation: {
      a: {
        style: 'curved',
        direction: 'up',
        mag: 0.95,
      },
      b: ['curved', 'down', 0.45],
    },
    fromPrev: {
      duration: null,
      translation: {
        a: ['curved', 'down', 0.2],
        b: ['curved', 'down', 0.2],
      },
    },
    fromNext: {
      duration: 2,
      translation: {
        a: ['curved', 'down', 0.2],
        b: ['curved', 'down', 0.2],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

## TypeEquationForm

A single form definition can either be:

-   an equation phrase [TypeEquationPhrase][185]
-   or an equation form object [TypeEquationFormObject][194]
-   or an object of subforms:

     {
        subform1: ([TypeEquationPhrase][185] \| [TypeEquationFormObject][194]),
        subform2: ...
     },


## TypeEquationForms

An object of equation forms where each key is the form name and each value
is a form defintion [TypeEquationForm][197]


## TypeFormRestart

When an equation form series is restarted, or cycled back to the first form
in the series, then two special animations can be defined with this object:

-   `moveFrom`: the equation will move from a location (usually another equation of the same form)
-   `pulse`: An element will be pulsed when the animation is finished.

The default values in the pulse object are are:

-   `duration`: 1s
-   `scale`: 1.1

### Properties

-   `formRestart` **{moveFrom: ([Point][465]? | [DiagramElementCollection][452])?, pulse: {duration: [number][459]?, scale: [number][459]?, element: [DiagramElement][457]??}?}?**

## TypeEquationGoToFormOptions

Options object for [Equation#goToForm][509].

Often, `goToForm` is called to animate from a shown form to a desired form.
Therefore there will be some equation elements that:

-   Are currently shown, but need to be hidden as they are not in the desired form
-   Are currently shown, are in the desired form, and need to be moved to the
    correct layout position for the desired form
-   Are currently hidden and need to be shown in the desired form

The order that elements are shown, hidden and moved is defined by the
`animate` property:

-   `'move'`: Dissolve out elements to hide, move existing elements to new,
    dissolve in elements that need to be shown
-   `'dissolveInThenMove'`: Dissolve out the elements to hide, dissolve in the
    elements that need to be shown in the correct locations of the form, then
    move existing elements to their correct locations
-   `'dissolve'`: Dissolve out the entire current form, and then dissolve in the entire new form
-   `'moveFrom'`: Shows the desired form at the position defined in the
    formRestart property of [EQN_Equation][202], then moves it to the
    current location
-   `'pulse'`: Same as `'dissolve'`, but once finished will pulse the element
    defined in the pulse object in the formRestart property of [EQN_Equation][202]

If a form is already animating, then the `ifAnimating` property will define
the behavior of the animation:

-   `cancelGoTo: true`, `skipToTarget: true`: Current animation will skip to
    the end, and current goTo call will be cancelled
-   `cancelGoTo: true`, `skipToTarget: false`: Current animation will stop in
    its current state, and current goTo call will be cancelled
-   `cancelGoTo: false`, `skipToTarget: true`: Current animation will skip to
    the end, and current goTo call will then be executed
-   `cancelGoTo: false`, `skipToTarget: false`: Current animation will stop in
    its current state, and current goTo call will be executed

## Shapes




## OBJ_Texture

Texture definition object

A texture file is an image file like a jpg, or png.

Textures can be used instead of colors to fill a shape in WebGL.

Textures are effectively overlaid on a shape. Therefore, to overlay the
texture with the correct offset, magnification and aspect ratio the texture
must be mapped to the space the shape's vertices are defined in
(vertex space).

This is done by defining a window, or rectangle, for the texture file
(`mapFrom`) and a similar window in vertex space (`mapTo`).
The texture is then offset and scaled such that its window aligns with the
vertex space window.

The texture file has coordinates of (0, 0) in the bottom left corner and
(1, 1) in the top right corner.

Therefore, to make a 1000 x 500 image fill a 2 x 1 rectangle in vertex space
centered at (0, 0) you would define:

    mapFrom: new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)
    mapTo: new Rect(-1, -0.5, 2, 1)

If instead you wanted to zoom the image in the same rectange by a factor of 2
you could either:

    mapFrom: new Rect(0.25, 0.25, 0.5, 0.5)
    mapTo: new Rect(-1, -0.5, 2, 1)

or

    mapFrom: new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)
    mapTo: new Rect(-2, -1, 4, 2)

Two ways of doing this are provided as sometimes it is more convenient to
think about the window on the image, and other times the window in vertex
space.

If the shape has fill outside the texture boundaries then either the
texture can be repeated, or a pixel from the border (edge) of the image is
used (called clamping to edge).
WebGL only allows images that are square with a side length that is a
power of 2 (such as 16, 32, 64, 128 etc) to be repeated. All other images
can only be clamped to their edge.

To repeat all other image resolutions, a texture can be mapped to a rectangle
and then the rectangle repeated throughout the diagram.

### Properties

-   `src` **[string][450]** The url or location of the image
-   `mapTo` **[Rect][456]?** vertex space window (`new Rect(-1, -1, 2, 2)`)
-   `mapFrom` **[Rect][456]?** image space window (`new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1)`)
-   `repeat` **[boolean][458]?** `true` will tile the image. Only works with
    images that are square whose number of side pixels is a power of 2 (`false`)
-   `onLoad` **function (): void?** 

## OBJ_Polyline

Polyline shape options object

![][512]

A polyline is a series of lines that are connected end to end. It is defined
by a series of points which are the ends and corners of the polyline.

The series of points is a zero width ideal polyline, and so to see it we must
give it some width. This width can either be grown on one side of the
ideal polyline or grown on both sides of it equally.

Here we define a line's side as either the _positive_ side, or _negative_
side. If a line is defined from p1 to p2, then the _positive_ side is the
side where the line moves if it is rotated around p1 in the positive (counter
clockwise) direction. Thus the order of the points that define the line
defines which side is positive and negative. A polyline is made up of many
lines end to end, and thus itself will have a positive and negative side
dependent on the order of points.

Each point, or line connection, creates a corner that will have an _inside_
angle (&lt;180º) and an _outside_ angle (>180º or reflex angle).

Growing width on an outside corner can be challenging. As the corner becomes
sharper, the outside width joins at a point further and further from the
ideal corner. Eventually trucating the corner makes more visual sense
and therefore, a minimum angle (`minAutoCornerAngle`) is used to
specify when the corner should be drawn, and when it should be truncated.

### Properties

    numbers for dash line where first number is length of line, second number is
    length of gap and then the pattern repeats - can use more than one dash length
    and gap  - e.g. [0.1, 0.01, 0.02, 0.01] produces a lines with a long dash,
    short gap, short dash, short gap and then repeats.

    or boths sides (`line`) of the line, or completely custom (`line`)

A word or phrase within the line can have custom formatting by defining a
unique ID surrounded in “|” characters. The unique id is then used as a key
in the modifiers object to define the formatting and replacement text. By
default, the unique id will be used as the replacement text.

Each line can have custom formatting or justification by defining a
[OBJ_TextLinesDefinition][257] object instead or a string in the lines
array.

To escape the modifier special character "|", use a forward slash. e.g.

`"This line has a uses the special char: /|"`

## PulseOptions

Pulse options

An element can have its scale pulsed of some `duration` with some
`frequency`.

If the scale is pulsed from the center of an object, the object will simply
grow larger then smaller. If however, the scale is pulse from the side of the
object, then the object will grow larger while moving away from the pulse
center. Therefore the center of the scale pulse is defined with `centerOn`,
`xAlign` and `yAlign`.

How the pulse transitions from a scale of 1 to the pulse scale (s) is defined
by the `progression`. A triangle progression will linearly progress from 1
to s and back to 1 over time. Alternately `sinusoid` slows the progression
at the minimums and maximums of the pulse.

### Properties

-   `xAlign` **(`"left"` \| `"center"` \| `"right"` \| `"origin"` \| [number][459])?** horiontal alignment with pulse center

    alignment with pulse center
-   `centerOn` **(null | [DiagramElement][457] \| [TypeParsablePoint][464])?** center
    of pulse
-   `space` **(`"diagram"` \| `"gl"` \| `"local"` \| `"vertex"`)?** space the
    `centerOn` property operates when `centerOn` is a `TypeParsablePoint`
-   `frequency` **[number][459]?** pulse frequency in Hz
-   `duration` **[number][459]?** pulse duration in seconds
-   `scale` **[number][459]?** pulse scale
-   `progression` **(`"sinusoid"` \| `"triangle"`)?** function that defines
    how the scale should progress over time (`sinusoid`)
-   `x` **(`"left"` \| `"center"` \| `"right"` \| `"origin"` \| [number][459])?** 
-   `y` **(`"bottom"` \| `"middle"` \| `"top"` \| `"origin"` \| [number][459])?** 
-   `time` **[number][459]?** 
-   `done` **function (any): void??**
