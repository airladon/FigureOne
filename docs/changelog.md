## 0.10.14
* Bug Fix: When ivid was watched to end, playing ivid would restart audio but not slides
* Add `layout` property to equation form and default it to 'all' making equations rearrange themselves on every show


## 0.10.13
* Bug Fix: When figure is not on top of window stack, 'beforeDraw' notifications were not being sent


## 0.10.12
* Bug Fix: Recording state wasn't recording form property positionsSet, and default values of equation elements were left undefined


## 0.10.11
* Start playing video after audio starts instead of before
* Add two notifications `startingPlayback` and `startingPause` for players to switch state before recorder processing completes
* Bug Fix: Pulse settings was missing from recorder seek state in PulseAnimationStep


## 0.10.10
* Bug Fix: Remove console statement
* Bug Fix: Recorder playback of non-auto events not working with touchUp


## 0.10.9
* Bug Fix: Rare GL related bug that happens when using textures and drawn elements together on non-chrome browsers fixed
* Bug Fix: Global TouchUp events no longer interrupt cursor movements when a video is playing (bug introduced in 0.10.6)
* Bug Fix: Video is now automatically paused/played when headphones are removed/mounted

## 0.10.8
* Add defaultAccent to lines

## 0.10.7
* Bug fix: When seeking backwards through a recording, the slide navigator doesn't go to the first slide unless the time is 0.


## 0.10.6
* Added lazylayout to equation forms which delays their layout till they are first shown. Using lazyLayout will shorten initial load time when many equation forms are being used, but will increase the size of video-track files when recording (the increase can be reduced by using `addReference` properties in slides where significant equation change happens).
* Bug fix: when using multiple `in` and `out` animation steps in slide transitions, the automatic showing/hiding of elements was sometimes not working in the correct order.
* Bug fix: mouse and touch up events are now tied to the window instead of the canvas preventing sticky touch down when a touch up happens outside of canvas.
